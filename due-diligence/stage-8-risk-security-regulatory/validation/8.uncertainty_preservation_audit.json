If Apollo benefits from conservatism, will block reform preserving fragmentation and cost disadvantage through exit (harms exit valuation but protects against pre-exit disasters).

Difference between scenarios: $50M-$150M EBITDA improvement (reform optimistic) vs $100M-$300M EBITDA damage + multiple compression (reform pessimistic) = $150M-$450M swing in exit value.

Each unknown includes: (1) TYPE classification (UNKNOWN vs UNKNOWABLE), (2) BUSINESS IMPACT quantification/scenario description, (3) WHAT WOULD REDUCE UNCERTAINTY specification. Pattern: Did NOT speculate where data unavailable, did NOT assume average/typical when company-specific data missing, did NOT conflate 'plausible' with 'confirmed'. Distinguished between UNKNOWN (could be discovered with additional data/investigation) vs UNKNOWABLE (structurally impossible to observe without insider access or controlled experiment). Appropriately characterized business impact: many unknowns have $200M-$500M+ valuation consequences, not trivial. Demonstrated that WHAT WE DON'T KNOW is as material as WHAT WE DO KNOW. NO ISSUES with uncertainty preservation - Stage 8 maintained epistemic humility throughout."
