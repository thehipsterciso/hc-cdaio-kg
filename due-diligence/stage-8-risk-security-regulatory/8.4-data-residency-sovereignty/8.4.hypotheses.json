        "10-K/10-Q risk factors discussing 'compliance requirements' generically without quantifying revenue impact of jurisdictional immobility",
        "Earnings call transcripts where management discusses 'scale' or 'platform leverage' without acknowledging regional fragmentation",

      "notes": "Searching public Rackspace investor materials for quantification of immobile customer segments - NOT FOUND. 10-K Risk Factors discuss 'must comply with data localization laws' using GENERIC language but do NOT quantify revenue exposure or operational constraints. Marketing materials emphasize 'global reach' and 'multi-region infrastructure' without disclosing that FedRAMP customers cannot use multi-region (must stay CONUS), UK Sovereign customers cannot use global infrastructure (architecturally isolated), etc. The ABSENCE of quantified disclosure about immobility is itself evidence supporting hypothesis - if management fully understood immobility constraints' magnitude, would likely disclose as material business characteristic. Alternative explanation: management understands but chooses not to disclose to avoid investor concern (disclosure risk). Either explanation supports hypothesis that external stakeholders (investors, acquirers) have INCOMPLETE information about geographic inflexibility limiting business model flexibility."

      "notes": "Stage 8.1 explicitly documents '2-3x security cost per customer' for UK Sovereign vs global operations due to forced isolation. FedRAMP US-citizen personnel requirements create labor cost premium (US cybersecurity engineers median $120K salary vs India $30K salary for similar roles = 4x labor cost, not all roles offshore-able but support/operations often 40-50% offshore in commercial models). Cannot find evidence of cost parity or margin premium offsetting higher costs - suggests immobile segments operate at STRUCTURAL DISADVANTAGE. Competitive analysis: AWS GovCloud revenue not separately disclosed but AWS overall gross margin ~30%, suggesting ability to absorb compliance costs through scale; Rackspace smaller FedRAMP base means less ability to absorb fixed compliance costs. Hypothesis SUPPORTED with HIGH CONFIDENCE - immobility creates permanent cost disadvantage."

UK Sovereign architectural isolation (Stage 8.1) prevents integration with acquirer infrastructure by design. HITRUST re-certification takes 6-12 months per Stage 1.5 - healthcare customers at risk during transition. VMware Sovereign Cloud certification is Rackspace-specific, acquirer would need separate certification (12-18 months) - UK government customers will not wait, will terminate and migrate to alternative providers. No evidence found that these barriers have been overcome in peer M&A. Cloud M&A transactions (IBM Red Hat, Broadcom VMware, private equity MSP rollups) focus on COMMERCIAL CUSTOMER consolidation, often divest or separate regulated segments (suggesting market recognizes immobile segments are non-integrable). Hypothesis SUPPORTED - immobility is PRIMARY integration barrier, overriding technical compatibility."

Summing these estimates: 35-50% of revenue could be in immobile or conditionally-mobile segments. 10-K does NOT provide segment breakout by regulatory regime - reports only 'Public Cloud', 'Private Cloud', 'Professional Services' segments which DO NOT align with immobility boundaries. The ABSENCE of residency-based segment reporting prevents external validation but absence itself supports hypothesis that management has not quantified immobility concentration. Hypothesis SUPPORTED with MODERATE confidence (estimation-based, not fact-based)."
