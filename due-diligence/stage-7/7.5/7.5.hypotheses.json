  "synthesis_notes": "Four hypotheses tested, all REFUTED or WEAKENED. FINDING: Information asymmetry is pervasive, structural, and institutionalized—not temporary gaps or security requirements. Asymmetries serve organizational purposes: (1) Gatekeeper power preservation (narrative control, discretion protection, accountability avoidance), (2) Organizational efficiency optimization (speed over coordination, velocity over quality, autonomy over oversight), (3) Board information processing efficiency (aggregated data faster to consume than granularity, finance filtering reduces Board burden). ASYMMETRY MECHANISMS CONFIRMED: System ownership (finance owns investor relations, sales owns CRM, operations owns monitoring—ownership creates control), authority-based gatekeeping (CEO ultimate decision authority, finance regulatory authority, sales booking authority enable legitimate filtering), technical expertise asymmetry (operations security/infrastructure knowledge creates challenge barriers), first-mover advantage (sales establishes deal truth proactively, corrections come late reactively), measurement absence enabling externalization (satisfaction measurement absent internally allows customer/external platform control). ASYMMETRY PERSISTENCE EXPLAINED: No governance correcting (no CDO, no data governance committee, no operating committee per Stage 7.1, 4.1), three CEOs three years without correction initiatives (systemic acceptance not individual oversight, asymmetries survive CEO transitions indicating institutional embedding per Stage 4.5), orphaned domains remain orphaned (satisfaction, profitability validation, prevention, customer count reconciliation—no owners assigned despite prolonged gaps per Stage 7.4), current architecture serves organizational interests (efficiency, autonomy, power) outweighing costs (decision quality, oversight, coordination) in organizational prioritization. DISCONFIRMING EVIDENCE SEARCHES COMPREHENSIVE: Searched for common platforms (none found), operating committee (absent), transparency initiatives (none documented), asymmetry reduction trend (none visible, gaps persist/worsen), governance building (void continues), orphaned domain ownership assignment (none assigned), correction efforts (none visible except walk away policy Q4 2024 which is reactive symptom treatment not proactive gap closure). HYPOTHESIS TESTING METHODOLOGY: For each hypothesis, stated what evidence would SUPPORT (demonstrate information equality, security-only restrictions, adequate Board oversight, active correction), stated what evidence would DISCONFIRM (demonstrate asymmetry, power-based restrictions, Board impairment, persistent gaps), actively searched for disconfirming evidence through earlier stage outputs and available data, updated hypothesis status based on evidence balance. UNCERTAINTY PRESERVED: Where evidence insufficient to determine (Board awareness of specific data quality issues, finance visibility to deal-level CRM, customer success CRM access), uncertainty explicitly noted in evidence assessment rather than resolved through assumption. M&A IMPLICATIONS: Asymmetries create diligence complexity (acquirer requests data operational managers don't routinely see exposing internal gaps), valuation uncertainty (Board oversight impairment means acquirer cannot rely on Board operational governance quality, must independently assess operational reality), integration impediment (acquirer information norms likely different, culture clash from access expectations, integration requires either Rackspace adoption of acquirer information practices—culture change—or acquirer tolerance of Rackspace asymmetries—suboptimal integration)."
