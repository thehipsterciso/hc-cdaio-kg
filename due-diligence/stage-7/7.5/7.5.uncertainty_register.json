      "unknown": "Board operational data access granularity and quality awareness—what operational metrics/dashboards Board receives, whether Board aware of data quality issues (CRM profitability overstatement, customer count ambiguity, satisfaction measurement absence, incident frequency tracking absence, orphaned domains)",
      "type": "UNKNOWN",
      "decision_impact": "Cannot fully assess Board operational oversight adequacy—if Board unaware of operational data quality issues, Board oversight impaired creating governance gap (Board operational strategy decisions uninformed by data quality reality, Board cannot effectively challenge management operational claims without operational detail). Cannot evaluate Board-management information alignment for M&A—acquirer expects Board aware of operational issues standard in acquirer governance, if Rackspace Board uninformed creates disclosure gap risk (acquirer discovers during diligence Board oversight shallower than represented, questions Board operational governance quality, may revalue or require Board governance strengthening post-close). Cannot determine whether Board operational oversight impairment is information architecture problem (Board doesn't receive operational detail) or Board engagement problem (Board receives detail but doesn't engage operationally, Board focuses financial governance not operational).",
      "what_would_reduce_uncertainty": "Board materials review (operational dashboards content, management reports to Board, committee reports showing what operational data Board sees and at what granularity), Board meeting minutes (questions Board asks about operational metrics indicating Board information depth and awareness of data quality issues, Board discussions revealing Board operational knowledge level), Board member interviews (Board self-assessment of operational visibility, Board awareness of orphaned domains/data quality gaps, Board views on operational oversight adequacy vs limitations), CEO/CFO Board reporting process documentation (what operational information packaged for Board, what granularity provided, what data quality caveats disclosed), audit committee minutes specifically (audit findings reported to committee, whether committee tracks remediation, whether operational data quality issues escalated to audit committee)."

      "unknown": "Finance adjustment methodology disclosure to operations—whether operations sees and understands how finance adjusts operational forecasts for external investor guidance, whether adjustment rationale communicated or methodology documented for operations reference",
      "type": "UNKNOWN",
      "decision_impact": "Cannot assess operations-finance alignment depth—if adjustment fully opaque, operations plans on internal forecast unaware of external guidance derivation, maximum misalignment risk (operations resourced for internal plan, measured on external guidance, divergence creates systematic execution failures). If adjustment partially visible but rationale unclear, operations sees divergence without understanding justification, creates finance-operations relationship tension (operations views finance skepticism as unjustified, finance views operations optimism as requiring correction, relationship damaged by information asymmetry). Cannot evaluate adjustment methodology appropriateness—if methodology undocumented even to finance, adjustment may be inconsistent over time (adjustment based on finance judgment varying by finance analyst, forecast period, market conditions without systematic standards), forecast accuracy suffers from methodology inconsistency. If methodology documented but operations-unseen, cannot assess whether adjustment excessive (finance over-conservatism understating operational capability to investors) or insufficient (finance adjustment inadequate, operational optimism reaching investors creating miss risk).",
      "what_would_reduce_uncertainty": "Finance forecasting process documentation (adjustment methodology by operational domain—pipeline discount %, customer count reconciliation approach, margin estimate conservatism, revenue recognition timing adjustments), operations interviews (does operations see finance adjustment methodology, understand adjustment rationale, have input to adjustment standards, or discover divergence only through external guidance publication), historical adjustment accuracy analysis (compare adjusted forecast to actual results validating adjustment effectiveness, assess whether adjustment systematically over-conservative, under-conservative, or appropriately calibrated), finance-operations forecast reconciliation meetings documentation (if meetings exist where finance explains adjustment to operations, meeting notes/agendas showing information exchange, if meetings don't exist confirms adjustment opacity)."

      "type": "UNKNOWN",
      "decision_impact": "Cannot assess policy sustainability—if CEO reviewing high deal volume consuming significant bandwidth (worsening Stage 4.2 bottleneck already severe), policy may lapse when CEO bandwidth exhausted, policy non-transferable across CEO transitions if remains CEO-personal not institutionalized (three CEOs three years per Stage 4.5, policy established Q4 2024 by current CEO, sustainability across next transition uncertain). Cannot evaluate policy effectiveness—if margins not improving post-policy Q4 2024 forward, policy filtering insufficient (CEO not catching unprofitable deals, or deal volume small making policy symbolic not material), if margins improving significantly, policy working but at cost of sales effort waste/customer relationship damage from post-signature rejections. Cannot determine Board oversight adequacy—if Board lacks implementation metrics, Board cannot assess policy working as intended or requiring adjustment (rejection rate too high indicates sales process problem requiring structural fix, rate too low indicates policy not materially affecting quality), Board cannot assess CEO bandwidth sustainability for ongoing policy execution.",
      "what_would_reduce_uncertainty": "Walk away policy tracking data (deals reviewed count Q4 2024-present, rejection rate % and trend, rejection reasons categorization showing which deal types/customers/terms CEO rejecting, policy implementation documentation showing criteria even if informal), margin performance correlation (segment margins Q4 2024-present vs Q1-Q3 2024 pre-policy, margin improvement timing relative to policy start indicating policy effectiveness attribution), CEO time allocation assessment (hours per week CEO spends on deal review, deals reviewed per hour indicating review burden, CEO self-assessment of policy bandwidth consumption), Board reporting review (whether policy metrics included in Board operational materials, Board questions about policy indicating Board visibility level, Board committee oversight of policy implementation)."

      "unknown": "Customer success or account management role authority, CRM access, and satisfaction visibility—whether customer success function exists with clear executive ownership, whether customer success has CRM access to pipeline/relationship data, whether customer success monitors satisfaction through any mechanism",
      "type": "UNKNOWN",
      "decision_impact": "Cannot fully assess satisfaction measurement absence cause—if customer success role exists but under-resourced or lacks authority, satisfaction measurement absence may be resource constraint not accountability avoidance (customer success wants to measure but lacks capacity/mandate). If customer success role doesn't exist or authority unclear, satisfaction orphaning per Stage 7.4 confirmed structurally (no owner possible because function absent). Cannot evaluate churn prediction capability—if customer success exists with CRM access and relationship data visibility, customer success may have informal churn risk assessment even without systematic satisfaction measurement (relationship intelligence compensating for measurement absence partially), if customer success lacks CRM access or doesn't exist, churn prediction entirely absent (no satisfaction data, no relationship intelligence, churn discovered purely reactively). Cannot determine account management information asymmetry—if account management has CRM visibility to sales pipeline and customer relationship history, account management information position relatively strong for retention intervention, if account management lacks CRM access operating blind to sales relationship and pipeline (information silo between sales acquisition and account management retention creating handoff failures).",
      "what_would_reduce_uncertainty": "Organization chart and role documentation (customer success executive identified at C-level or VP-level, reporting relationship, team size, mandate scope), CRM access controls review (which roles have what CRM permissions, whether customer success can view pipeline opportunities and customer relationship data, whether access restricted to post-signature only), customer success processes documentation (account health scoring, churn prediction methodology, satisfaction monitoring practices even if informal, retention intervention triggers), account management interviews (what customer information account management has access to, whether sees sales CRM history and pipeline, whether monitors satisfaction formally or informally, awareness of Trustpilot/BBB customer complaints)."

      "type": "UNKNOWN",
      "decision_impact": "Cannot distinguish between measurement absence and reporting absence—if operations tracks frequency internally but doesn't report systematically to executives/Board, asymmetry is reporting gatekeeping (operations possesses data, chooses not to share preventing accountability), if operations doesn't track frequency even internally, asymmetry is measurement absence (operations lacks data to report, frequency unknown to anyone). Affects prevention ROI calculability—if frequency data exists somewhere in operations (incident logs analyzable for frequency trends even if analysis not performed routinely), prevention ROI calculable from existing data (analysis gap not data gap), if frequency data doesn't exist (incidents not logged consistently, logs don't enable frequency analysis), prevention ROI requires new measurement infrastructure not just analysis of existing data. Cannot assess operations prevention knowledge—if operations informally aware of frequency patterns through operational experience (operations staff recognize recurrence even without measurement), operations may be consciously avoiding frequency reporting (gatekeeping to avoid prevention accountability per Stage 7.4), if operations genuinely unaware of frequency (measurement absence means operations doesn't know if incidents recurring), prevention orphaning is measurement gap not accountability avoidance.",
      "what_would_reduce_uncertainty": "Operations incident tracking systems review (incident logging practices, log data fields captured, whether logs enable frequency analysis even if not performed), operations reporting to executives documentation (incident reports to CEO/CRO/Board, what metrics included, whether frequency reported or only response capability), operations interviews (whether operations informally tracks or aware of frequency patterns, whether frequency discussed internally, why frequency not reported systematically if data exists), incident log analysis (retrospective frequency analysis from existing logs if logs exist, determine recurrence patterns, frequency trends, whether ransomware multi-month pattern quantifiable from logs or purely qualitative observation)."

      "unknown": "Delivery team CRM access and deal profitability validation participation—whether delivery has any CRM read access to sales pipeline opportunities, whether delivery consulted pre-signature for profitability validation on deals delivery will execute, whether delivery input to sales profitability estimates systematized or ad-hoc",
      "type": "UNKNOWN",
      "decision_impact": "Cannot fully assess deal profitability validation gap severity—if delivery has CRM read access but doesn't proactively validate (delivery can see deals but doesn't engage until invited by sales), validation gap is process/incentive problem not access problem (delivery has visibility, lacks mandate or incentive to validate early). If delivery completely lacks CRM access (delivery blind to pipeline until sales engages delivery for specific deal), validation gap is access asymmetry (delivery structurally prevented from early validation by information architecture). Cannot determine whether delivery profitability validation attempted but ineffective vs never attempted—if delivery consulted pre-signature but delivery input not binding (sales can proceed despite delivery profitability concerns), validation gap is authority problem per Stage 4.1 (delivery provides input, sales overrides, delivery lacks deal rejection authority). If delivery not consulted until post-signature, validation gap is coordination problem (delivery excluded from sales process, no validation attempted pre-commitment). Affects walk away policy necessity assessment—CEO walk away policy Q4 2024 may be compensating for delivery validation absence, if delivery validation gap addressed structurally (delivery early CRM access, validation mandate, rejection authority), walk away policy potentially unnecessary (validation happens at T0-T1 by delivery, not T5 by CEO), CEO bandwidth freed.",
      "what_would_reduce_uncertainty": "CRM access controls review (whether delivery roles have any CRM permissions, read-only vs edit, what data visible if access exists), sales-delivery coordination process documentation (when delivery engaged in sales cycle, whether delivery consulted for profitability estimates, whether delivery input to CRM opportunity data or delivery input separate from CRM), delivery interviews (whether delivery sees sales pipeline opportunities, when delivery learns about deals, whether delivery can challenge sales profitability claims and whether challenges effective), sales interviews (whether sales solicits delivery input for profitability validation, how sales handles delivery profitability concerns if raised, whether delivery input influences deal pursuit decisions)."

  "synthesis_notes": "Six material unknowns identified where uncertainty prevents full assessment of information asymmetry severity, causes, and organizational impact. UNCERTAINTY PATTERNS: (1) AWARENESS UNCERTAINTIES: Whether Board aware of operational data quality issues, whether operations aware of finance adjustment methodology, whether operations tracks incident frequency—cannot distinguish ignorance from gatekeeping without knowing if information possessors communicate to information seekers. (2) PROCESS UNCERTAINTIES: Whether walk away policy metrics tracked/reported, whether customer success exists and has CRM access, whether delivery consulted for deal profitability—cannot assess asymmetry correction feasibility without knowing current processes. (3) ATTRIBUTION UNCERTAINTIES: Whether asymmetries are access problems (restricted parties lack access), reporting problems (data possessors don't share), measurement problems (data doesn't exist), or authority problems (input provided but not binding). DECISION IMPACT CONSISTENT: All uncertainties affect M&A valuation and integration risk—acquirer diligence discovers information asymmetries, must assess whether Board oversight adequate (Board awareness uncertainty affects governance quality assessment), whether operations-finance aligned (adjustment methodology uncertainty affects operational execution risk), whether policy sustainable (walk away metrics uncertainty affects margin improvement sustainability), whether functions coordinate (CRM access uncertainties affect organizational effectiveness). UNCERTAINTY REDUCTION METHODS: Documentation review (Board materials, finance forecasting process, incident tracking systems, CRM access controls, sales-delivery coordination processes), interview-based discovery (Board members, operational managers, finance, delivery, operations assessing information flow and awareness), data analysis (historical adjustment accuracy, incident log retrospective frequency analysis, walk away policy implementation metrics if tracked). UNCERTAINTY PRESERVATION CRITICAL: Uncertainties NOT resolved through assumption or extrapolation—explicitly flagged as unknowns affecting analysis confidence. Where evidence insufficient to determine (Board awareness, finance methodology disclosure, walk away metrics, customer success role, incident frequency tracking, delivery CRM access), uncertainty explicitly preserved rather than resolved to maintain analytical rigor per Stage 0 uncertainty classification and preservation mandate. M&A DUE DILIGENCE IMPLICATIONS: These uncertainties become diligence focus areas—acquirer must independently assess Board operational oversight quality (Board materials review, Board interviews confirming awareness), operations-finance alignment (finance forecasting process documentation, operations interviews), policy sustainability (walk away tracking data, CEO bandwidth assessment), customer success capability (org chart, role documentation, satisfaction monitoring practices), incident management maturity (frequency tracking, prevention accountability), delivery-sales coordination (CRM access, profitability validation process). Uncertainty resolution during diligence may reveal larger asymmetries than currently visible (if Board unaware, oversight impairment worse than assessed; if finance adjustment undocumented to finance, methodology inconsistency risk; if incident frequency unmeasured even by operations, prevention capability weaker than response capability suggests)."
