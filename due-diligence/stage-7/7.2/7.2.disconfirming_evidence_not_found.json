      "hypothesis_tested": "H7.2-DNF-A: Data transformations are documented and standardized—methodology transparent and reproducible",
      "disconfirming_evidence_sought": "Evidence of transformation documentation: CRM qualification criteria published, finance adjustment methodology disclosed, aggregation formulas documented, incident classification standards defined. Evidence of standardization: Consistent application across time periods, consistent application across jurisdictions/BUs, changes to methodology governed and communicated. Evidence of transparency: Methodology accessible to data consumers, transformation logic auditable, cross-functional alignment on methodology.",
      "search_conducted": "Searched Stage 7.1 uncertainty register for transformation methodology documentation (CRM qualification, finance adjustment, aggregation, manual overrides all listed as UNKNOWN). Searched Stage 7.2 for evidence of documented transformations across 5 major flows (deal value, customer identity, support performance, incident data, multi-jurisdictional operations). Searched for governance infrastructure that would enforce documentation (Stage 7.1 H7.1-B governance processes absent—no data governance committee, no documentation requirements). Searched CEO interventions for methodology references (walk away policy Q4 2024 criteria-based or case-by-case? Sales refresh Q3 2024 data-driven methodology or judgment?). Searched for cross-functional alignment evidence (operating committee discussing methodology, deal review board establishing standards—Stage 4.1 coordination infrastructure absent).",
      "evidence_found": "NONE disconfirming hypothesis. No transformation documentation identified across any major flow. CRM qualification criteria unknown (Stage 7.2 uncertainty: 'what thresholds, filters sales applies'), finance adjustment methodology opaque (Stage 7.1 uncertainty: 'how finance discounts operational data'), multi-jurisdictional aggregation formulas undocumented (Stage 7.2 uncertainty: 'how jurisdiction metrics combined'), incident classification standards not visible, CEO walk away policy criteria not documented (Stage 7.1 uncertainty: 'threshold criteria not documented, case-by-case judgment'). No evidence of standardization: Sales refresh Q3 2024 personnel change not methodology change, walk away policy Q4 2024 CEO discretion not criteria-based, finance adjustment methodology survivor of three CFO transitions (consistency unknown). No evidence of transparency: Transformation methodology UNKNOWN across Stage 7.1 and 7.2 uncertainty registers indicates non-disclosure, cross-functional disputes over methodology persist (Stage 7.1 contested domains) indicating alignment absent.",
      "conclusion": "Hypothesis H7.2-DNF-A REFUTED. Disconfirming evidence (documentation, standardization, transparency) not found. Transformation methodology opacity pervasive. Documentation absence persistent across: Three CEO transitions (walk away policy criteria never codified), sales refresh Q3 2024 (performance methodology not clarified), governance void (Stage 7.1 H7.1-B—no infrastructure to require/enforce documentation), authority-driven transformations (Stage 7.2 Pattern 4—controllers benefit from opacity preventing contestation). Opacity symptomatic not accidental: Finance adjustment opacity prevents operations challenge, CRM qualification opacity preserves sales flexibility, CEO filtering opacity preserves discretion, incident classification opacity blocks customer success reclassification. Documentation would transfer power from transformation controller to governance process—opacity preserves controller authority."

      "disconfirming_evidence_sought": "Evidence that transformations improve quality: Validation rules applied at transformation steps, data cleansing processes documented, enrichment from external sources, quality metrics improving at each transformation step. Evidence that downstream data more accurate than upstream: Finance adjustment corrects operational errors, CEO filtering improves deal quality vs raw CRM, aggregation reconciles inconsistencies across sources.",
      "search_conducted": "Searched for data quality measurement at transformation steps (Stage 7.2 uncertainty: 'accuracy, completeness, timeliness at T1-T5 unknown'). Searched for validation infrastructure (Stage 7.1 governance void—no data governance, no data quality monitoring visible). Searched for evidence that transformations catch errors: Does finance adjustment identify operational forecast errors? Does CEO walk away policy improve margin vs accepting all CRM deals? Does incident classification prevent misreporting? Searched transformation outcomes: Deal value flow—margin erosion -13%/-3% indicates CRM entry quality poor, but post-transformation (CEO filtering Q4 2024) indicates prior transformations (sales qualification, finance adjustment) didn't prevent quality deterioration. Support performance flow—SLA stable but satisfaction declining indicates transformation to 'satisfied customers' claim not validated. Incident flow—response capability strong but recurrence indicates transformation to 'stable operations' claim not validated.",
      "evidence_found": "NONE disconfirming hypothesis. No evidence transformations improve data quality—extensive evidence transformations degrade quality through semantic drift. Deal value transformation: CRM T1 overstates profitability by 13-15% (margin erosion), subsequent transformations (finance reporting T4, CEO filtering T5) don't correct entry error—filtering reactive after margin erosion severe not proactive quality improvement. Customer identity transformation: Parallel definitions create inconsistency not clarity—CRM N, billing M, support K customer counts diverge not converge. Support performance transformation: Activity-to-outcome conflation degrades meaning—'SLA met' (precise activity metric) transformed to 'customer satisfied' (imprecise outcome claim contradicted by Trustpilot). Incident transformation: Capability-to-frequency conflation degrades meaning—'response capable' transformed to 'operations stable' contradicted by recurrence. Multi-jurisdictional transformation: Aggregation erases material variance (5-6x coordination multiplier invisible) degrading decision quality. No data quality metrics at transformation steps (Stage 7.2 uncertainty)—quality degradation unmeasured and uncorrected.",
      "conclusion": "Hypothesis H7.2-DNF-B REFUTED. Disconfirming evidence (quality improvement) not found—quality degradation found instead. Transformations systematically degrade data quality through: Semantic drift (meaning changes without outcome validation), variance erasure (aggregation hides material heterogeneity), political bias embedding (controllers optimize for local benefit not accuracy), temporal staleness (transformation lag creates obsolescence). Walk away policy Q4 2024 reactive recognition after transformation chain failed to prevent margin erosion—if transformations improved quality, CEO filtering unnecessary. Quality degradation predictable: Activity-outcome drift (Pattern 1) conflates controllable metric with uncontrollable outcome, aggregation variance erasure (Pattern 2) loses operational detail, manual override inconsistency (Pattern 3) fragments truth, authority-controlled transformation (Pattern 4) embeds political bias, temporal drift (Pattern 5) creates obsolescence. No quality improvement infrastructure: No validation at transformation steps, no reconciliation processes, no error detection/correction, no quality metrics improving over time."

Evidence of systematic correction: Drift corrections based on analysis not crisis, methodology updated to prevent recurrence, governance processes enforce ongoing alignment.",
      "search_conducted": "Searched for proactive drift detection infrastructure: Does finance monitor CRM forecast accuracy and recalibrate? Does support correlate SLA compliance with satisfaction surveys to detect divergence? Does operations track incident frequency alongside response capability?

Sales refresh Q3 2024—proactive (preventing quality decline) or reactive (responding to margin pressure)? Customer satisfaction measurement—proactive internal tracking or reactive external platform discovery? Searched historical pattern: Three CEOs three years—did any CEO build drift detection/correction infrastructure? Did 2023 reorganization create governance layer for drift management?",
      "evidence_found": "NONE disconfirming hypothesis. No proactive drift detection found—all evidence indicates reactive crisis discovery. Walk away policy Q4 2024 reactive: Established after margin erosion severe (-13%/-3%), not anticipatory before erosion began—indicates CRM-profitability drift undetected until crisis. Sales refresh Q3 2024 reactive: Personnel change after performance issues, not proactive before quality deterioration—indicates pipeline quality drift undetected until escalation. Customer satisfaction discovery reactive: Trustpilot 'consistently worse' 2024 indicates prolonged deterioration, internal satisfaction measurement absent or ignored (Stage 7.1 uncertainty: 'whether satisfaction data collected and suppressed or not collected')—external platforms surface drift, not internal monitoring. Incident recurrence reactive: Ransomware multi-month, zero-day Sept 2024 indicate response capability didn't prevent recurrence—operations capability-frequency drift undetected until repeated customer impact. No drift correction infrastructure: No reconciliation processes documented, no correlation analysis visible (SLA-satisfaction, CRM-profitability, response-frequency), no periodic methodology review, no governance mandate for alignment monitoring.",
      "conclusion": "Hypothesis H7.2-DNF-C REFUTED. Disconfirming evidence (proactive detection/correction) not found. Semantic drift discovered reactively through external crisis not internal monitoring. Discovery pattern: External crisis surfaces reality contradicting internal claims → CEO reactive intervention → Intervention addresses symptom (filter deals, change personnel) not cause (semantic drift patterns persist). Walk away policy and sales refresh reactive recognitions not proactive prevention—semantic drift accumulated undetected for months-years until margin erosion/satisfaction decline/incident recurrence severe enough to force CEO attention. Reactive discovery enabled by: Activity-outcome divergence unmeasured (support doesn't track satisfaction systematically, sales doesn't validate profitability at entry, operations doesn't measure prevention), CEO bottleneck (Stage 4.2—serial processing prevents proactive monitoring bandwidth), governance void (Stage 7.1 H7.1-B—no infrastructure for systematic drift detection). Correction absence enabled by: Interventions treat symptoms not causes (walk away policy filters deals but doesn't fix CRM qualification methodology, sales refresh changes people but doesn't fix pipeline validation), structural causes unchanged (authority-accountability gaps Stage 4.1, incentive misalignments Stage 4.4 persist), three CEOs three years prevents institutional learning (drift correction knowledge lost across transitions)."

Evidence of neutrality enforcement: Transformation methodology changes require cross-functional approval, controllers cannot unilaterally optimize, disputes resolved on accuracy merit not authority, political beneficiaries of bias lose in governance process.",
      "search_conducted": "Searched for governance infrastructure (Stage 4.1, Stage 7.1 H7.1-B): Operating committee exists? Deal review board exists? Data governance committee exists? Chief Data Officer or equivalent exists? Searched for transformation oversight evidence: Who approves CRM qualification methodology changes—sales unilaterally or cross-functional committee? Who validates finance adjustment appropriateness—CFO discretion or Board oversight with operations input? Who determines incident classification standards—operations unilaterally or with customer success/compliance input? Searched for dispute resolution mechanism: When sales-delivery dispute CRM quality, how resolved—escalate to CEO personal arbitration or systematic methodology review? Walk away policy Q4 2024 governance—criteria established by cross-functional committee or CEO discretion? Sales refresh Q3 2024 governance—performance assessment methodology agreed or CEO judgment?",

Stage 4.1 documents governance void: No operating committee, no deal review board, no empowered coordinators, no data governance visible. Stage 7.1 H7.1-B confirms: Conflicts escalate to CEO for reactive personal arbitration not systematic governance resolution. Transformation control unilateral: Sales controls CRM qualification without delivery input (authority-accountability gap enables optimism), finance controls adjustment without operations input (conservatism protects finance reputation but under-resources operations), operations controls incident classification without customer success input (severity understatement protects operations metrics but obscures customer impact), CEO controls filtering without documented criteria (discretion preserved but creates sales unpredictability). Dispute resolution political not technical: Walk away policy CEO discretion case-by-case (not criteria-based methodology), sales refresh CEO judgment on performance (methodology not transparent), customer escalations attempt CEO direct contact (systematic escalation path absent BBB: 'cannot reach CEO'), finance adjustment methodology contested but unresolved (Stage 7.1 uncertainty: methodology unknown).",
      "conclusion": "Hypothesis H7.2-DNF-D REFUTED. Disconfirming evidence (governance oversight, neutrality enforcement) not found. Political bias embedding through transformation control systematic and unchecked. Transformation authority (Stage 7.2 Pattern 4) follows power structure (Stage 7.1 epistemic power centers) not accuracy optimization: Sales controls CRM because sales entry function (not because sales best positioned to assess profitability), finance controls adjustment because finance investor interface (not because finance best positioned to forecast operations), CEO controls filtering because CEO ultimate authority (not because CEO best positioned to assess deal-level economics). Governance absence persistent: Three CEOs three years, none built governance infrastructure—walk away policy reactive personal arbitration not systematic governance, sales refresh reactive personnel change not methodological reform, 2023 reorganization created BU accountability structure (Stage 4.1) but not governance layer. Political bias benefits identifiable and measurable: Sales CRM optimism benefits sales compensation (bookings-based Stage 4.4), finance conservatism protects investor credibility, operations incident understatement benefits performance metrics, CEO discretion preserves flexibility—each controller optimizes transformation for local benefit while externalizing costs (margin erosion, satisfaction decline, resource misallocation) to other functions or future periods."

      "conclusion": "Hypothesis H7.2-DNF-E REFUTED. Disconfirming evidence (executive drift awareness) not found. Leadership appears to discover semantic drift reactively through crisis not proactively through understanding. Reactive discovery pattern: Margin erosion severe → CEO establishes walk away policy discovering CRM-profitability gap. Satisfaction complaints external → CEO escalations discovering SLA-satisfaction divergence. Incident recurrence visible → Operations capability-stability gap surfaces. Three CEOs three years compounds awareness deficit: Institutional knowledge of drift patterns doesn't transfer across CEO transitions—each CEO rediscovers semantic drift patterns through crisis not inherited understanding. Awareness absence enabled by: Coordination bottlenecks (Stage 4.2) prevent cross-functional truth reconciliation at working level (sales-delivery profitability disputes don't surface to CEO until severe), governance void (Stage 7.1 H7.1-B) means no systematic drift reporting to executives (no data quality dashboard, no alignment monitoring, no methodology review cadence), CEO bandwidth exhaustion (Stage 4.2 bottleneck) prevents proactive drift investigation—CEO capacity consumed by reactive firefighting. Awareness deficit creates: Repeated surprise discoveries (walk away policy Q4 2024, sales refresh Q3 2024 reactive interventions discovering drift late), decision-making based on transformed data assumed accurate (resource allocation, investor guidance, brand claims), M&A valuation risk if acquirer discovers drift patterns executive team didn't acknowledge or address proactively."

  "synthesis_notes": "Comprehensive search for disconfirming evidence (transformation documentation, quality improvement, proactive drift detection, governance oversight, executive awareness) found NONE. All hypotheses testing positive transformation governance refuted. Evidence convergent: Transformation methodology opaque not documented, transformations degrade quality through semantic drift not improve through validation, drift discovered reactively through crisis not proactively through monitoring, political bias embedding unchecked by governance, executives discover drift through surprise not anticipate through awareness. Refutations interconnected through structural root causes: Governance void (Stage 7.1 H7.1-B) prevents documentation/oversight requirements, authority-accountability misalignment (Stage 4.1) allows transformation controllers to optimize locally without enterprise accountability, incentive misalignment (Stage 4.4) rewards political bias (sales CRM optimism, finance conservatism) over accuracy, CEO bottleneck (Stage 4.2) prevents proactive drift monitoring/correction bandwidth, three CEOs three years prevents institutional learning (drift knowledge lost across transitions). Walk away policy Q4 2024 and sales refresh Q3 2024 reactive recognitions after semantic drift patterns created material deterioration—interventions treat symptoms (filter deals, change personnel) not causes (transformation governance void, semantic drift patterns structural). Transformation quality unlikely to improve without: Governance infrastructure building (operating committee, deal review board, data governance committee creating oversight), authority reallocation (cross-functional transformation control not unilateral), methodology documentation/standardization (transparency enabling validation and contestation), systematic drift monitoring (activity-outcome correlation, internal-external alignment, aggregation variance analysis)—but CEO bottleneck and capital constraints ($1.3B debt Stage 5) prevent infrastructure investment while reactive firefighting continues."
