Original CRM meaning: Sales optimistic revenue potential. Final meaning: CEO-validated profitable revenue post-delivery-cost-discovery. Drift magnitude severe: Private Cloud margin -13%, Public Cloud -3% indicates CRM values systematically overstate profitability by 13-15+ percentage points. Semantic gap: Sales 'qualified opportunity' ≠ Finance 'profitable deal' ≠ CEO 'acceptable deal'.

Investor guidance at risk—revenue projections based on CRM meaning but CEO filter T5 reduces revenue (FY2024 -7% revenue decline includes walk away policy impact).

Finance benefits from conservative T4 aggregation: Segment-level reporting obscures deal-level profitability variance, hides worst performers, averages disasters with successes. CEO forced to benefit from T5 intervention authority: Walk away policy establishes CEO as profitability gatekeeper, centralizes deal approval, increases CEO power but also bottleneck (Stage 4.2). Delivery suffers drift: Inherits deals at T2 (post-booking) with cost reality unknown, accountable for T3 margin execution without T1 entry authority (Stage 4.1 authority-accountability mismatch).",

Sales velocity slows—fewer opportunities pass profitability screen. Sales compensation declines—bookings volume reduced if quality required. CRM pipeline value drops—inflated values removed, investor pipeline metrics decline visibly. If enforced immediately without transition: Revenue growth stalls further (already -7% FY2024), sales organization revolts (comp structure disrupted), delivery coordination overhead spikes (profitability assessment required for every opportunity), CEO bottleneck worsens (deal review volume increases).
