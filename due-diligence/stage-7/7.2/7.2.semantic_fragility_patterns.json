      "description": "Systematic pattern where organizations optimize measurable internal activities while unmeasured external outcomes degrade. Activity metrics selected for controllability (objective, immediate, directly influenced by actor) not validity (predicting customer/financial outcomes). Transformation steps progressively distance measurement from outcome: Activity measured → Activity reported → Outcome claimed → Reality experienced. Drift enables local optimization while systemic value destruction continues invisible.",
      "instances_observed": [
        "Support: SLA response time (activity controllable) measured and reported → Resolution claimed → Customer satisfaction (outcome uncontrollable) declining but unmeasured internally → Trustpilot 'consistently worse' 2024 (reality). Drift: 'meeting SLA' transformed into 'satisfied customers' without outcome verification.",
        "Sales: Bookings volume (activity controllable) measured in CRM → Revenue forecast → Profitability claimed → Margin reality (outcome uncontrollable) eroding -13%/-3%. Drift: 'signed deals' transformed into 'profitable deals' without margin verification at entry.",
        "Operations: Incident response MTTD/MTTR (activity controllable) measured → Stability claimed → Prevention reality (outcome uncontrollable) unmeasured → Incidents recurring (ransomware multi-month, zero-day Sept 2024). Drift: 'responding to incidents' transformed into 'stable operations' without frequency tracking.",
        "Operations: Utilization dashboards (activity controllable) reported → Capacity adequacy claimed → Multi-jurisdictional constraints (outcome uncontrollable) unmeasured → Capacity non-fungible reality invisible. Drift: 'resources exist' transformed into 'resources available' without jurisdiction isolation visibility."

Incentive misalignment (Stage 4.4) rewards controllable activity optimization over uncontrollable outcome achievement. Coordination bottlenecks (Stage 4.2) prevent outcome feedback reaching activity owners—customer satisfaction doesn't inform SLA metric design, margin reality doesn't inform CRM qualification criteria. CEO bottleneck (Stage 4.2) prevents systematic activity-outcome reconciliation—CEO reactively discovers divergence (walk away policy Q4 2024, sales refresh Q3 2024) but lacks bandwidth to redesign measurement systems.",
      "fragility_mechanism": "Pattern fragile because outcome reality eventually surfaces through: Customer churn (satisfaction drift), margin erosion forcing reactive policy (profitability drift), incident recurrence during critical moment (stability drift), investor scrutiny during M&A (all drifts). Drift sustainable only while outcomes lag or remain unmeasured—when outcome truth emerges, activity-outcome divergence forces crisis intervention. Three CEOs in three years indicates crisis frequency exceeding intervention capacity (Stage 4.5 talent constraints).",

If satisfaction measured systematically (NPS/CSAT surveys), may contradict 'Fanatical Support' brand claims. If customer profitability calculated by deal, may reveal CRM pipeline quality systematically overstated. If incident frequency analyzed (not just response), may reveal stability claims unsupported. Activity-outcome drift quantification may trigger valuation reduction or earnout provisions contingent on outcome achievement not activity reporting.",

Aggregation formula treats non-fungible resources as fungible, isolated jurisdictions as integrated, diverse customer segments as homogeneous. Variance information lost during transformation: Jurisdiction-specific → Enterprise aggregate → Investor reporting → Decision based on false fungibility assumption. Pattern enables decisions misaligned with operational reality.",

        "Customer metrics: CRM customers (contractual), billing customers (revenue-generating), support customers (operationally engaged) aggregated into single 'customer count' for investor reporting. Transformation erases variance: Sales reports N CRM accounts, Finance reports M billing accounts (M < N), Support tracks K engaged accounts (K ≠ M) → External reporting uses single number → Churn calculation definition-dependent → Customer lifetime value miscalculated.",
        "Deal profitability: Private Cloud -13% margin, Public Cloud -3% margin, other segments positive aggregated into corporate gross margin. Transformation erases variance: Segment-level losses visible internally → Corporate aggregate masks specific segment distress → Investor guidance based on aggregate → Resource allocation doesn't target loss segments → Deterioration continues until severe (walk away policy Q4 2024 needed).",
        "Incident impact: Customer-facing incidents, internal incidents, vendor incidents aggregated into enterprise incident count. Transformation erases variance: Customer impact incidents (brand risk, churn risk) mixed with internal incidents (operational inefficiency) → Enterprise count doesn't prioritize by impact → Resource allocation misaligned with customer risk → Critical customer incidents under-resourced while low-impact incidents measured equally."

Automated data flows produce one truth, manual overrides produce parallel truth, inconsistency persists because override authority supersedes data governance. Pattern: System generates value → Authority manually adjusts → Adjusted value becomes authoritative → Original value retained in source system → Two truths coexist → Downstream consumers uncertain which truth valid. Inconsistency compounds with each override, creating truth fragmentation.",

Override frequency unknown—if CEO filters 10% of deals, CRM systematically overstates viable pipeline by 10%+.",

Adjustment methodology not documented (Stage 7.1 uncertainty)—inconsistency magnitude unknown.",
        "Sales refresh Q3 2024: CRM contains performance data for sales personnel → CEO manually determines underperformance (criteria unclear) → Personnel changes executed → CRM performance data not systematically adjusted for territory changes, quota recalibrations → Performance truth contested—did personnel underperform or quotas/territories unrealistic? Override creates interpretation ambiguity retroactively.",

Sales optimizes on CRM truth while CEO acts on filtered truth—sales efforts misallocated to deals CEO will reject. Operations plans on optimistic truth while finance commits on conservative truth—resource mismatches create execution failures. Manual overrides scale poorly—CEO walk away policy requires CEO review each deal (Stage 4.2 bottleneck), override frequency limited by CEO bandwidth not deal volume.

Inconsistency resolution requires authority holder availability (CEO)—but three CEOs three years indicates authority continuity absent.

Transformation control: Finance owns external truth adjustment, optimizes for investor credibility not operational alignment.",

  "synthesis_notes": "Five systematic semantic fragility patterns identified: (1) Activity-outcome drift enables local optimization while outcomes degrade invisible, (2) Aggregation erases variance creating false fungibility assumptions, (3) Manual overrides create inconsistency fragmenting truth, (4) Authority controls transformation embedding political bias in meaning evolution, (5) Temporal drift creates decisions on semantically stale data. Patterns interconnected—not independent failure modes. Activity-outcome drift (pattern 1) enabled by transformation authority (pattern 4): Operations controls response metrics not prevention metrics. Aggregation variance erasure (pattern 2) enabled by manual override inconsistency (pattern 3): Finance aggregates jurisdiction data then manually adjusts creating opacity. Temporal drift (pattern 5) compounds all patterns: Activity-outcome divergence widens over time, aggregation formulas become obsolete as business evolves, manual overrides accumulate inconsistency, transformation authority biases compound. All patterns structurally enabled by Stage 4 execution constraints: Authority-accountability misalignment (Stage 4.1) prevents outcome measurement enforcement, incentive misalignment (Stage 4.4) rewards activity optimization, coordination bottlenecks (Stage 4.2) create temporal lags, governance void (Stage 7.1) prevents methodology standardization. Patterns fragile to M&A diligence forcing semantic reconciliation across all transformation steps. Walk away policy Q4 2024 and sales refresh Q3 2024 reactive recognitions after pattern-enabled deterioration severe—interventions treat symptoms (filtering bad deals, changing personnel) not causes (semantic fragility patterns persist)."
