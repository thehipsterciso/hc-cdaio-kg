      "notes": "Hypothesis decisively refuted. Semantic meaning changes systematically across all tested transformation chains. Pattern: Source data measured for controllability/objectivity (CRM opportunity exists, SLA time met, incident responded to) but transformed meaning claims outcome/value (deal profitable, customer satisfied, operations stable) without outcome measurement following transformation. Drift magnitude material: 13-15% profitability overstatement, satisfaction claiming contradicted by external platforms, stability claiming contradicted by incident recurrence. Refutation indicates transformations not neutral technical operations—semantic drift embedded through: Activity-to-outcome conflation (controllable activity transformed into outcome claim), aggregation erasing variance (heterogeneous jurisdictions/customers/segments homogenized), authority-driven adjustments (manual overrides change meaning to suit power holder). Semantic preservation would require: Outcome measurement at each transformation step, variance retention through aggregation, authority-driven adjustments documented and reconciled—none visible."

Pattern: Function controlling transformation step optimizes methodology for own objectives—sales optimizes CRM for bookings volume, finance optimizes adjustment for investor credibility, operations optimizes classification for performance metrics, CEO optimizes filtering for discretion. Political beneficiaries identifiable: Sales benefits from CRM optimism through higher compensation, finance benefits from conservatism through reputation protection, operations benefits from severity understatement through better performance reports. Transformation neutrality would require: Methodology governance with cross-functional oversight, transformation accountability for downstream consequences, dispute resolution based on accuracy not authority—governance void (Stage 7.1 H7.1-B) prevents neutrality enforcement. Refutation indicates transformation design reflects power structure (Stage 7.1 epistemic power centers) not technical optimization—whoever controls transformation embeds bias serving their interests."

Pattern: Transformation outputs trusted and used for decisions (resource allocation based on CRM pipeline, investor guidance based on finance-adjusted forecasts, brand claims based on SLA compliance) but accuracy not tested until external crisis forces validation (margin erosion, satisfaction complaints, incident recurrence). Validation reactive not proactive—walk away policy and sales refresh are post-crisis validations discovering prolonged drift. Validation absence enabled by: Governance void (Stage 7.1 H7.1-B) means no validation requirements, activity-outcome divergence (7.2.semantic_fragility_patterns.json Pattern 1) means outcome truth unavailable for validation, coordination bottlenecks (Stage 4.2) mean CEO lacks bandwidth for systematic validation. Refutation indicates transformation outputs accepted on authority (transformation controller's claim) not accuracy (independent verification)—trust-based not validation-based data consumption. M&A risk: Acquirer validation may discover accuracy failures systematic not isolated."

      "notes": "Hypothesis refuted comprehensively. Metrics semantically fragmented across functions not standardized. Pattern: Same metric name ('pipeline', 'customer', 'incident', 'performance') means different things to different functions based on: Function's role (sales entry vs delivery buildability vs CEO profitability), function's incentive (sales optimistic, finance conservative), function's authority (sales controls CRM entry, CEO controls filtering), function's measurement capability (support measures activity, customers experience outcome). Semantic consistency would require: Standardized metric definitions with enterprise glossary, cross-functional governance of metric meaning (data governance committee), disambiguation mechanisms when multiple meanings valid—governance void (Stage 7.1 H7.1-B) prevents standardization. Refutation indicates semantic fragmentation symptomatic of coordination gaps (Stage 4.1 no operating committee, no coordinators) and authority fragmentation (Stage 7.1 epistemic power centers)—each function controls its own truth, semantic alignment not enforced. Fragmentation creates: Misaligned decisions (sales optimizes on one pipeline meaning, CEO rejects based on different meaning), coordination failures (delivery discovers deal unbuildable despite CRM 'qualified'), resource misallocation (hiring based on inflated pipeline, under-resourcing based on discounted forecast)."

Pattern: Multiple transformation layers separate executive view from operational reality—CEO sees CRM opportunities filtered by sales qualification (T1), finance adjustment (T2-T4), and CEO profitability policy (T5), five steps from deal economics source truth. Aggregation layers separate executive view from variance—multi-jurisdictional operations aggregated into enterprise metrics erasing jurisdiction isolation, customer counts aggregated across parallel systems erasing definitional differences. Manual adjustment layers separate executive view from operational claims—finance conservatively adjusts operations forecasts, CEO manually filters CRM pipeline, both adjustments interposed between operations and executive consumption. Executives distant from operational reality enabled by: Coordination bottlenecks (Stage 4.2) force serial processing through CEO, CEO lacks bandwidth to consume primary operational data, consumes transformed summaries. Refutation indicates executive decision-making vulnerability to: Semantic drift accumulation (each transformation layer adds drift), aggregation variance erasure (executive decisions assume fungibility/homogeneity where variance material), manual adjustment bias (finance/CEO filters embed political choices). M&A risk: Acquirer diligence may demand primary data access discovering executive-consumed derivatives materially misrepresent operational reality."

  "synthesis_notes": "All hypotheses testing transformation neutrality, semantic preservation, validation rigor, semantic consistency, primary data usage either refuted or weakened. Convergent pattern: Transformations systematically change meaning (H7.2-A), changes benefit transformation controller politically (H7.2-B), accuracy not validated proactively (H7.2-C), semantic fragmentation persists across functions (H7.2-D), executives consume heavily derived data not primary sources (H7.2-E). Refutations interconnected: Semantic drift (H7.2-A) enabled by political transformation control (H7.2-B), validation absence (H7.2-C) allows drift accumulation, semantic fragmentation (H7.2-D) symptoms of unvalidated transformation divergence, executive distance from primary data (H7.2-E) prevents drift detection. Root causes structural: Authority-accountability misalignment (Stage 4.1) allows transformation controllers to optimize locally without downstream accountability, incentive misalignment (Stage 4.4) rewards transformation bias (sales CRM optimism, finance conservatism), governance void (Stage 7.1 H7.1-B) prevents validation/standardization enforcement, coordination bottlenecks (Stage 4.2) force executive reliance on transformed summaries. Walk away policy Q4 2024 and sales refresh Q3 2024 reactive interventions after hypotheses-refuted patterns created severe deterioration—interventions don't resolve structural causes (governance void, authority gaps persist), semantic fragility patterns continue."
