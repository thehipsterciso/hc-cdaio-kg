  "synthesis": "SYSTEMATIC LATENCY PATTERN IDENTIFIED: Decisions consistently made on stale, pre-stabilization, or absent data across six material domains. Latency spans hours (incident response) to indefinite (satisfaction, incident frequency absent measurement), with most executive decisions operating on weeks-to-quarters lag. DECISION DISTORTION PERVASIVE: Deal commitments made before profitability truth knowable (T2 signature before T3 delivery validation), margin correction three quarters after erosion began (Q4 2024 policy after Q1-Q3 value destruction), satisfaction interventions months after deterioration or post-churn (T3+ after T0 customer experience), prevention investment without frequency data (indefinite latency from measurement absence), operations-finance misalignment from forecast adjustment opacity (weeks latency operations discovering external guidance divergence), Board operational oversight quarters lag (T4 Board visibility after T0 operational issue emergence). LATENCY CAUSES STRUCTURAL: Information architecture creates latency through measurement absence (satisfaction, incident frequency), system ownership silos (CRM-delivery gap), reporting cycles (quarterly financials, quarterly board governance), decision timing misalignment (CEO walk away post-commitment, finance adjustment post-operations forecast), coordination infrastructure absence (no operating committee enabling real-time cross-functional alignment per Stage 4.1). VALUE DESTRUCTION QUANTIFIABLE: Q1-Q3 2024 margin erosion to -13%/-3% from three-quarter correction latency, cash flow negative Q2 2024 from profitability deterioration latency enabled, Trustpilot 'consistently worse' 2024 from satisfaction measurement absence creating indefinite intervention latency, sales effort waste and customer relationship damage from CEO walk away post-commitment latency. M&A RISK: Acquirer discovers decisions made on stale data not current reality, latency quantifiable through margin erosion timeline (three quarters value destruction), satisfaction deterioration visibility gap (months lag), Board operational oversight lag (quarters), prevention effectiveness unknowable (frequency measurement absent), forecast misalignment from adjustment latency. Acquirer compares Rackspace latencies to acquirer operational tempo (likely faster with monthly/real-time visibility, systematic cross-functional coordination, measurement infrastructure for satisfaction and frequency). Acquirer post-close may require latency reduction initiatives: measurement infrastructure building (satisfaction, frequency), coordination acceleration (operating committee, real-time data sharing), decision timing optimization (walk away pre-commitment not post, prevention investment with frequency data), Board operational oversight frequency increase."
