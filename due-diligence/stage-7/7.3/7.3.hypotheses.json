Pattern: Enforcement strong where external validation mechanism exists (financial auditor, compliance auditor, customer disputes provide accuracy feedback), enforcement weak where only internal governance available but governance void (Stage 7.1 H7.1-B no operating committee, no data governance committee). External reporting accurate (finance-controlled, audit-validated Stage 7.3), internal operations inaccurate (function-controlled, no validation Stage 7.3). Quality variance magnitude material: External financials audit-clean, internal CRM profitability off by 13-15 percentage points, internal customer counts fragmented without reconciliation, internal satisfaction unmeasured while external platforms show 'consistently worse' 2024. Selective enforcement creates INTERNAL-EXTERNAL QUALITY GAP: Strategic decisions based on inaccurate internal operational data (resource allocation on inflated CRM pipeline, service claims based on SLA not satisfaction, stability claims based on response not frequency) despite external reporting accuracy. Refutation indicates: External validation substitutes for absent internal governance—without external auditor/customer forcing accuracy, data quality degrades to level function-controller finds convenient (sales optimistic CRM, support SLA-optimized, operations response-focused) not level enterprise strategy requires."

      "notes": "Hypothesis comprehensively refuted. Error escalation NOT systematic—crisis-driven and politically selective. Pattern: Errors persist until crisis forces CEO reactive intervention (walk away policy after margin erosion severe, sales refresh after pipeline quality deteriorates) or external platform visibility creates brand risk (BBB complaints, Trustpilot decline). Escalation threshold determined by: (1) Political cost of correction (high political cost errors tolerated longer—CRM zero tolerance threatens sales model, satisfaction measurement threatens support narrative), (2) CEO bandwidth availability (Stage 4.2 bottleneck means only highest-severity crises receive attention), (3) externalization feasibility (errors whose costs can be externalized to other functions/customers not escalated—sales CRM optimism externalizes margin risk to delivery, support SLA optimization externalizes satisfaction risk to customers). No systematic escalation infrastructure: No operating committee for cross-functional error escalation (Stage 4.1 coordination gaps), no deal review board for profitability error detection, no data governance committee for quality issue escalation (Stage 7.1 H7.1-B governance void). Escalation paths informal: Errors escalate through ad-hoc CEO attention (customer complaint reaches CEO, margin report reviewed by CEO, sales performance questioned by CEO) not through documented process. Error correction episodic not systematic: Walk away policy corrects immediate deal profitability but doesn't reform CRM methodology (structural error persists), sales refresh changes personnel but doesn't systematize pipeline validation (error pattern continues). Refutation indicates: Error tolerance functions as organizational policy—errors tolerated deliberately (implicitly) when correction costs exceed tolerance costs, escalated only when tolerance costs (margin erosion, customer churn, brand damage, regulatory risk) exceed correction costs (sales disruption, support narrative change, prevention investment)."

Pattern: Organizations optimize for decision velocity over data accuracy—resource commitments made on available data (CRM pipeline, utilization metrics, SLA compliance) even when accuracy questionable, correction delayed until crisis forces intervention. Quality gates absent: No deal review board requiring profitability validation before resource allocation (Stage 4.1 coordination infrastructure absent), no data quality review before investor guidance (finance adjustment compensates for operational inaccuracy but doesn't block guidance), no satisfaction validation before brand claims (marketing proceeds despite measurement gap). Decision-makers proceed because: (1) Delay costs exceed inaccuracy costs initially (hiring delayed while pipeline validated loses talent to competitors, customer proposal delayed for capacity validation loses deal), (2) inaccuracy costs externalized (sales proceeds on optimistic CRM, delivery absorbs margin erosion later), (3) correction politically expensive (forcing CRM validation pre-decision threatens sales velocity, forcing satisfaction measurement pre-brand claim reveals SLA inadequacy). Walk away policy Q4 2024 reactive quality gate after years of unblocked decisions—policy establishes profitability filter only after margin erosion severe (-13%/-3%), validates decisions proceeded despite profitability uncertainty 2021-2024. Refutation indicates: Data quality treated as nice-to-have not requirement—decisions proceed on 'good enough' data (Stage 7.3 selective enforcement 'good enough acceptable' for internal operations), accuracy enforced only when external consequences immediate (financial reporting, regulatory compliance) not when internal strategy/operations."

      "notes": "Hypothesis cannot be conclusively validated or refuted—evidence mixed. SUPPORTING: Walk away policy Q4 2024 represents explicit error tolerance reduction for deal profitability (CEO now rejects unprofitable deals previously accepted), sales refresh Q3 2024 represents pipeline quality enforcement tightening. DISCONFIRMING: Interventions reactive not progressive (tolerance tightened only after crisis severe, not continuous improvement trajectory), interventions episodic not systematic (CEO personal attention creates temporary enforcement, no governance infrastructure institutionalizes), structural causes unchanged (authority-accountability gaps Stage 4.1, incentive misalignments Stage 4.4, governance void Stage 7.1 H7.1-B persist enabling accuracy deterioration recurrence). Likely scenario: Tolerance FLUCTUATES with CEO attention—tightens during crisis intervention (Q3-Q4 2024), loosens post-intervention as CEO attention shifts and governance absence allows quality decay. Three CEOs three years pattern (Stage 4.5) suggests episodic tightening-loosening cycles across CEO tenures—each CEO discovers quality issues, intervenes reactively, quality improves temporarily, CEO transitions or attention shifts, quality decays, cycle repeats. Progressive tightening would require: Governance infrastructure building (operating committee, deal review board, data governance committee establishing enterprise standards), transformation methodology reform (CRM qualification, finance adjustment, incident classification systematized Stage 7.2), accountability structure changes (authority-accountability alignment Stage 4.1, incentive realignment Stage 4.4)—none visible in Q3-Q4 2024 interventions. M&A implication: Acquirer cannot assume quality enforcement tightening trend—interventions episodic and CEO-dependent, post-acquisition quality may decay without CEO continuation or governance infrastructure substitution."

      "status": "REFUTED",
      "notes": "Hypothesis decisively refuted. Risk acceptance from data errors IMPLICIT through tolerance not EXPLICIT through governance. Pattern: Errors tolerated because correction not undertaken (CRM profitability overstatement tolerated because validation not required at entry), tolerance interpreted as implicit risk acceptance post-hoc, but no ex-ante documented decision to accept risk with owner assigned. Tolerance thresholds discovered reactively: CEO tolerance for CRM inaccuracy unknown until margin erosion severe enough to trigger walk away policy, threshold discovered through crisis not established proactively. CEO bandwidth tolerance for ticketing incompleteness unknown until escalation volume approaches capacity exhaustion (three CEOs three years indicates approaching), threshold discovered through workload not established proactively. Risk ownership ambiguous: When deal profitability error materializes (CRM optimistic, actual margin negative), who bears accountability? Sales benefited from optimism through compensation, delivery absorbed execution cost, finance managed aggregate reporting, CEO intervened—accountability diffuse not explicit. Board/executive awareness gaps: Board receives accurate external financial reporting (Stage 7.3 selective enforcement) but internal operational data inaccuracy (CRM, support, incident, aggregation) unknown to Board until crisis surfaces requiring CEO intervention (walk away policy, sales refresh). If Board aware of operational data inaccuracy pre-crisis, risk acceptance would be documented—absence of documentation suggests unawareness not deliberate acceptance. Refutation indicates: Data error tolerance functions as EMERGENT ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIOR not DESIGNED RISK GOVERNANCE—errors tolerated through inaction (measurement gaps, validation absence, reconciliation omission) not through explicit decision, risk discovered reactively when tolerance costs (margin erosion, churn, brand damage) exceed tolerance threshold triggering intervention. Implicit risk acceptance avoids governance accountability—no documented decision to tolerate CRM 13-15% overstatement means no owner accountable when overstatement causes margin erosion."

  "synthesis_notes": "All hypotheses testing systematic data quality governance refuted or inconclusive with weak support. H7.3-A REFUTED: Accuracy enforcement highly selective (external reporting accurate, internal operations inaccurate) not uniform.

H7.3-E REFUTED: Risk acceptance implicit through tolerance not explicit through governance, ownership ambiguous not assigned. Refutations interconnected through structural root causes: Governance void (Stage 7.1 H7.1-B) prevents explicit risk governance and systematic escalation, authority-accountability gaps (Stage 4.1) create ambiguous risk ownership, CEO bottleneck (Stage 4.2) forces reactive crisis intervention not proactive governance, three CEOs three years (Stage 4.5) prevents institutional learning and governance building, incentive misalignments (Stage 4.4) reward inaccuracy beneficiaries (sales CRM optimism) while externalizing costs (delivery margin absorption). Error tolerance pattern: TOLERANCE AS IMPLICIT ORGANIZATIONAL POLICY—errors tolerated when correction costs (political, resource, time) exceed tolerance costs (margin erosion, churn, brand damage, regulatory risk) in short term, tolerance ends when tolerance costs exceed correction costs triggering CEO reactive intervention, intervention treats symptoms (filter deals, change personnel) not causes (governance infrastructure, methodology reform, accountability assignment), tolerance resumes post-intervention. M&A implications: Acquirer discovers systematic data quality issues during diligence (operational metrics materially inaccurate), error tolerance pattern (implicit, crisis-driven, CEO-dependent) not transferable post-acquisition (acquirer CEO lacks bandwidth/detail for Rackspace episodic intervention, acquirer governance may require explicit risk acceptance not implicit tolerance), valuation uncertainty from operational data unreliability."
