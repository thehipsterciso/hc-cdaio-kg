      "mechanism_of_power": "Formal authority: CEO has ultimate decision rights, Board accountability. Reactive arbitration: Intervenes when conflicts surface (walk away policy, sales refresh, customer escalations Stage 4.1). Bottleneck power: All cross-functional truth conflicts escalate to CEO creating dependency (Stage 4.2 serial processing). Three CEOs in three years indicates power without sustainability—role defeats individuals, truth arbitration load exceeds capacity. CEO controls truth by personal judgment not systematic process—walk away policy requires CEO assess each deal profitability, sales refresh CEO-driven personnel decision.",
      "organizational_risk": "CEO truth arbitration bottleneck: Organizational truth-seeking stalls when CEO overloaded (Stage 4.2 throughput ceiling). Truth inconsistency: CEO reactive arbitration creates case-by-case truth not systematic—walk away policy application depends on CEO bandwidth. CEO transitions destroy institutional truth: Three CEOs in three years, each transition resets truth arbitration patterns, coordination collapses (Stage 4.5 turnover sensitivity). Successor CEO inherits truth conflicts without resolution infrastructure—operating committee absent (Stage 4.1), deal review board absent, governance void forces CEO personal arbitration perpetuating bottleneck.",

      "mechanism_of_power": "Regulatory authority: SEC reporting requirements, audit compliance create finance gatekeeping power. External credibility: Investor relations, Board reporting require finance sign-off—conservative adjustments override operational optimism. Conservative bias: Finance discounts operational data (CRM pipeline, customer counts, utilization) for external consumption creating parallel truths—internal operational vs external financial. Audit backing: External auditors validate finance truth, operational metrics lack external validation. Capital control: Finance controls budget allocation ($1.3B debt constraint), determines which operational truths get funded.",
      "organizational_risk": "Internal-external truth divergence: Finance external truth conservative, operations internal truth optimistic, gap widens creating coordination failures—operations plan using internal truth, finance commits using external truth, misalignment creates missed targets. Truth suppression risk: Finance conservative adjustment may suppress operational reality investors need to understand—optimistic operations metrics don't reach investors, deterioration invisible until severe. Capital misallocation: Finance controls investment based on external truth (conservative), operations needs based on internal truth (optimistic), mismatch starves operational execution or creates over-commitment.",

Performance metrics: Sales quotas, compensation, territory rankings based on CRM truth—sales controls performance measurement system. First-mover advantage: Sales establishes opportunity and customer truth proactively at CRM entry, downstream functions (delivery, finance) discover quality issues reactively post-signature—temporal power. Volume optimization: Sales incentive on bookings (Stage 4.4) encourages optimistic CRM entry, quality filtering downstream sales externalizes cost to delivery.",
      "organizational_risk": "Pipeline inflation: CRM truth optimistic encourages resource misallocation (hiring, capacity planning based on inflated pipeline). Downstream surprise: Delivery discovers deal quality post-signature when correction costly (contracts signed, customer expectations set). Forecast unreliability: Finance learns to discount CRM data but methodology contested, investor guidance uncertainty. Authority-accountability gap: Sales controls CRM truth but lacks profitability accountability (Stage 4.1), creates moral hazard—optimistic truth benefits sales (compensation, performance ratings) while costs borne by delivery (margin erosion) and finance (forecast misses).",

Monitoring control: Operations manages monitoring systems (ScienceLogic), controls what incidents reported and how measured—monitoring offline Sept 2024 indicates selective visibility. Crisis response: Operations gains power during incidents—all-hands mobilization, executive attention, budget exceptions for reactive spending—incident response validates operations importance. Regulatory interface: Operations manages FedRAMP, HIPAA compliance truth, controls what regulators see—compliance reporting power.",
      "organizational_risk": "Incident truth selective: Operations controls what incidents reported, how severity classified, what root causes disclosed—creates incident understatement risk. Prevention truth absence: Operations lacks authority/incentive to report prevention gaps (Stage 4.4 reactive incentive, Stage 4.1 no CRO)—incident frequency truth suppressed or unmeasured. Monitoring reliability contested: Sept 2024 dashboards offline during incident undermines operations truth claims—when monitoring fails during crisis, truth most uncertain when most needed. Regulatory exposure: If operations-controlled compliance truth incomplete or misleading, FedRAMP/HIPAA authorization jeopardy, regulatory investigation risk.",

Experience authority: Customers experience service delivery reality directly—support resolution, incident impact, satisfaction—operational metrics can't override customer experience. Churn action: Customer retention/churn ultimate truth validation—'voting with feet' mechanism. Analyst influence: Customer feedback to Gartner, Forrester, others shapes competitive positioning, market perception. Regulatory complaints: Customers can escalate to regulators (FCC, FTC, state AGs) creating external investigation trigger.",

Satisfaction truth lagging: Customer complaints surface after deterioration established—Trustpilot 'consistently worse' 2024 indicates prolonged degradation. Reputational damage persistent: Customer truth on external platforms permanent, public, discoverable—cannot be retracted or managed, damages competitive position and M&A attractiveness. Churn prediction failure: If internal satisfaction metrics don't capture customer truth, churn unpredictable—revenue forecast risk, customer lifetime value miscalculation.",

  "synthesis_notes": "Epistemic power fragmented across CEO (reactive arbiter), finance (external conservative truth), sales (pipeline optimistic truth), operations (incident response truth), customers (satisfaction external truth). No unified truth authority—creates parallel truths coexisting unreconciled. Power correlates with decision authority not data proximity: Finance controls external truth through reporting authority, sales controls pipeline through CRM authority, CEO arbitrates through ultimate decision authority—but support/delivery closest to operational reality lack authority to establish truth (Stage 4.1 coordination gaps). Customer external truth lacks internal authority—complaints inform escalations not systematic measurement changes. Three CEOs in three years indicates CEO truth arbitration power unsustainable—bottleneck (Stage 4.2), role defeats individuals (Stage 4.5 talent constraints). Truth power fragmentation creates execution risk: Parallel truths drive misaligned decisions, contested domains remain unresolved creating margin erosion/satisfaction decline/incident recurrence, M&A diligence may force truth reconciliation impossible or value-destructive."
