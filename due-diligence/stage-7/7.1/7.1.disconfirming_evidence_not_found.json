    {
      "hypothesis_tested": "H7.1-A: Truth is centralized in single authoritative source per domain",
      "disconfirming_evidence_sought": "Evidence that single system definitively resolves disputes per domain, conflicts resolved systematically by designated authority, executive decisions reference consistent authoritative sources",
      "search_conducted": "Examined all material domains for unified truth source: Deal profitability (searched for deal review board, unified profitability system), Customer metrics (searched for master customer database, unified customer definition), Support performance (searched for integrated satisfaction-SLA measurement), Incidents (searched for unified incident management with prevention), Operations (searched for enterprise operational system spanning jurisdictions), Pipeline (searched for quality-validated CRM with downstream integration). Examined governance structure for designated arbiters (Stage 4.1 authority analysis). Examined CEO interventions for systematic vs case-by-case patterns (walk away policy, sales refresh).",
      "evidence_found": "NONE disconfirming hypothesis. Every domain exhibits parallel or contested truths. No unified authoritative source identified for any material domain. No systematic conflict resolution found—CEO reactive arbitration only (walk away policy Q4 2024, sales refresh Q3 2024, customer escalations). No data governance infrastructure visible (Stage 4.1: no deal review board, no operating committee, no data stewardship roles). Pattern: System of record exists per domain (CRM, support ticketing, monitoring) but does not equal system of truth—routinely bypassed, overridden, or contradicted by external reality.",
      "conclusion": "Hypothesis H7.1-A REFUTED. Disconfirming evidence not found. Truth fragmentation pervasive across all tested domains. Centralized truth hypothesis contradicted by: CEO must personally arbitrate profitability disputes (indicates no systematic resolution), Finance must discount operational data for external reporting (indicates operational truth unreliable), Customers establish satisfaction truth on external platforms (indicates internal metrics don't capture reality), Operations incident response metrics contradicted by recurrence (indicates response truth doesn't reflect prevention truth)."

      "disconfirming_evidence_sought": "Evidence of data governance committee, documented resolution protocols, conflicts resolved at working level not executive, resolution based on methodology not politics",
      "search_conducted": "Searched Stage 4.1 authority analysis for governance infrastructure: Data governance committee, data council, data quality working groups, Chief Data Officer or equivalent, Deal review board for profitability validation, Operating committee for cross-functional conflicts, Customer success governance for satisfaction-SLA reconciliation. Searched CEO intervention patterns for systematic vs reactive: Walk away policy Q4 2024 criteria-based or case-by-case, Sales refresh Q3 2024 data-driven or political, Customer escalations systematic routing or ad-hoc. Searched finance adjustment for methodology documentation vs judgment.",
      "evidence_found": "NONE disconfirming hypothesis. No data governance infrastructure identified. Stage 4.1 documents: No deal review board, no operating committee, no empowered coordinators, no data stewardship roles visible. CEO interventions reactive and case-by-case: Walk away policy requires CEO personal assessment (not systematic criteria), sales refresh Q3 2024 personnel change (not data reconciliation process), customer escalations attempt CEO contact (BBB: 'cannot reach CEO'—indicates no systematic escalation path). Three CEOs in three years indicates reactive arbitration unsustainable (Stage 4.2 bottleneck, Stage 4.5 role defeats individuals).",
      "conclusion": "Hypothesis H7.1-B REFUTED. Disconfirming evidence not found. Governance void comprehensive. Conflicts escalate to CEO for personal reactive arbitration not systematic resolution. Absence of governance infrastructure persistent across: Three CEO transitions (governance void survives leadership changes), 2023 reorganization (created BU structure but not governance layer Stage 4.1), Sales refresh Q3 2024 (treated symptom with personnel change not cause with governance). CEO bottleneck (Stage 4.2) prevents governance infrastructure building—no bandwidth to design/implement systematic resolution while reactively arbitrating every dispute."

      "disconfirming_evidence_sought": "Evidence that SLA compliance predicts satisfaction, CRM pipeline predicts quality, incident response predicts stability, internal-external alignment demonstrated",
      "search_conducted": "Examined internal-external metric pairs across domains: Support (SLA compliance internal vs customer satisfaction external—Trustpilot, BBB), Sales (CRM pipeline internal vs deal profitability external—margin erosion, walk away policy), Operations (incident response metrics internal vs incident recurrence external—ransomware, zero-day), Customer counts (CRM internal vs churn reality external), Utilization (operations dashboards internal vs capacity reality external—multi-jurisdictional constraints). Searched for leading-lagging indicator validation: Do internal activities predict external outcomes over time? Does optimizing internal metrics improve external results?",
      "evidence_found": "NONE disconfirming hypothesis. Systematic internal-external divergence found across all tested domains. Support: SLA met (internal activity stable Stage 4.2) but satisfaction declining (external outcome Trustpilot 'consistently worse' 2024). Sales: Bookings maintained (CRM activity) but margins eroding (profitability outcome Private Cloud -13%, Public Cloud -3%). Operations: Incident response capable (MTTD/MTTR internal) but incidents recurring (stability outcome ransomware multi-month, zero-day Sept 2024). Pipeline: CRM opportunities (internal entry) but quality contested (external walk away policy Q4 2024 needed). Pattern persistent not episodic—divergence documented across Stages 4.2, 4.4 as structural measurement theater.",
      "conclusion": "Hypothesis H7.1-C REFUTED decisively. Disconfirming evidence not found—alignment not demonstrated anywhere. Internal-external divergence systematic indicates: Incentive optimization on measurable internal activities (Stage 4.4: support on SLA, sales on bookings, operations on response), Outcome measurement absent or suppressed (satisfaction not tracked systematically, profitability by deal contested, prevention not measured), Activity metrics create measurement theater—reports green while business deteriorates (Stage 4.4 activity-outcome divergence pattern). Walk away policy Q4 2024 reactive recognition after margin erosion severe—internal metrics failed to predict external deterioration."

Sales refresh Q3 2024—did margin erosion stop post-refresh indicating data quality improved? Walk away policy Q4 2024—proactive improvement or reactive damage control after deterioration? Customer satisfaction trend—improving or declining (Trustpilot 'consistently worse' 2024)? Searched for data infrastructure investment: Capital allocation to data systems, governance, measurement (Stage 5 capital constraints $1.3B debt). Searched for capability building: Chief Data Officer hired, data governance initiated, data quality programs launched.",
      "evidence_found": "NONE disconfirming hypothesis. Quality not improving, potentially degrading. Three CEOs—data disputes persist across all transitions (deal profitability, customer metrics, satisfaction-SLA gap, incident truth all unresolved). 2023 reorganization—created BU accountability but not authority, disputes persist (Stage 4.1 authority-accountability mismatch continues). Sales refresh Q3 2024—margin erosion continues post-refresh (Private Cloud -13%, Public Cloud -3% after refresh), indicates personnel change insufficient. Walk away policy Q4 2024—reactive after severe deterioration not proactive improvement. Satisfaction declining 2024 (Trustpilot 'consistently worse')—measurement-reality gap widening not narrowing. No data infrastructure investment visible—capital constrained, CEO bandwidth exhausted on reactive firefighting (Stage 4.2 bottleneck prevents governance building).",
      "conclusion": "Hypothesis H7.1-D WEAKENED/REFUTED. Disconfirming evidence (improvement) not found. Quality likely degrading: Activity-outcome divergence widening (satisfaction 'consistently worse'), margin erosion accelerating (necessitated walk away policy Q4 2024), CEO intervention frequency increasing (walk away, sales refresh, customer escalations). No improvement despite repeated interventions indicates: Interventions treat symptoms not causes (personnel changes, reactive policies vs structural reform), Data disputes symptomatic of authority-accountability-incentive misalignments (Stages 4.1, 4.4) not data management deficits, Structural causes unchanged across interventions—disputes persist and intensify."

  "synthesis_notes": "Comprehensive search for disconfirming evidence (truth centralization, systematic governance, internal-external alignment, quality improvement) found NONE. All hypotheses testing positive data governance patterns refuted. Evidence convergent: Truth fragmented not centralized, governance reactive/political not systematic, internal metrics diverge from external reality, quality not improving potentially degrading. Refutations not isolated—interconnected through structural root causes: Authority-accountability misalignment (Stage 4.1) prevents unified truth ownership, Incentive misalignment (Stage 4.4) drives activity optimization while outcomes degrade, CEO bottleneck (Stage 4.2) prevents governance infrastructure building, Capital constraints (Stage 5 $1.3B debt) limit data system investment. Data disputes symptomatic of execution constraints not causal—resolving requires structural reform (authority reallocation, incentive realignment, governance creation) not data management improvement. Three CEOs, sales refresh, walk away policy, 2023 reorganization all insufficient because structural causes unchanged."
