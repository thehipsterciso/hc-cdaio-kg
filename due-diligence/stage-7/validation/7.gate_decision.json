  "summary_rationale": "ALL EXIT CRITERIA MET AND EXCEEDED: (1) 7 contested domains identified (required ≥2), (2) 6 meaning drift transformations documented (required ≥3), (3) 5 chronic errors tolerated identified (required ≥1), (4) 5 epistemic gatekeepers documented (required ≥1), (5) 4 executive truth contradictions identified (required ≥1). QA CHECKS COMPLETE: Claim-evidence integrity verified (all claims trace to Stage 7.x artifacts), cross-sub-stage consistency confirmed (contradictions preserved not resolved), epistemic mechanism coverage complete (all 7 mechanisms documented), hypothesis discipline strong (27 hypotheses across sub-stages, all with falsification attempts, confirmation bias low), uncertainty preservation verified (unknowns maintained, not collapsed). COHERENCE ASSESSMENT: Enterprise functions THROUGH contradiction not despite it (CONTRADICTORY assessment per Stage 7.7). ANALYTICAL RIGOR: Evidence-based throughout, three CEO tenure temporal robustness, comprehensive falsification attempts, uncertainty explicitly preserved. CONSTITUTIONAL COMPLIANCE: Discovery only (no strategy/recommendations), claim discipline maintained (FACT vs INFERENCE), hypothesis falsification enforced, uncertainty preserved, no new facts introduced in validation. STAGE 7 PASSES - CLEARED FOR STAGE 8 PROGRESSION."
