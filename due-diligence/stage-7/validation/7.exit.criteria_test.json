Operations-to-finance forecast drift creates operations-finance execution misalignment (operations plans on operational truth, measured on finance-adjusted truth). Customer definition drift creates count ambiguity affecting territory sizing, financial reporting, operational tracking (planning and valuation uncertainty from definitional instability).

Customer count ambiguity tolerated for functional autonomy (reconciliation effort avoided, each function operates on divergent counts without coordination burden). Satisfaction measurement absence tolerated for accountability avoidance (measurement would create performance visibility some prefer to avoid per Stage 7.4 analysis). Each error documented with tolerance rationale (convenience, power preservation, accountability avoidance), persistence duration (years across CEO tenures), and organizational consequences (margin erosion, retention latency, planning uncertainty, decision quality degradation)."

Finance gatekeeping most powerful—controls external truth through adjustment methodology (undocumented per Stage 7.2), aggregation (segment margins reported masking deal-level profitability), and investor communication authority. CEO gatekeeping through walk away policy Q4 2024 creates individual deal approval authority post-signature (T5 weeks after commitment per Stage 7.6). Sales gatekeeping through CRM system ownership enables pipeline reality control (delivery lacks T0-T1 access per Stage 7.5, sales truth monopoly pre-commitment). Operations gatekeeping through technical expertise creates incident narrative authority (frequency unmeasured, response emphasized, prevention accountability absent per Stage 7.4). External platform gatekeeping through information inversion—customers measure satisfaction externally (Trustpilot) while Rackspace doesn't measure internally, truth externalized per Stage 7.5. Each gatekeeper documented with gatekeeping mechanisms, organizational risks from gatekeeping, and power effects (narrative control, decision disadvantage, oversight impairment)."

Deal profitability contradiction: CRO operates on CRM sales-optimistic truth (13-15% overstated), COO/delivery operates on cost reality truth discovered post-signature, CFO operates on finance-adjusted truth for external guidance—three executives, three truths, no systematic reconciliation per Stage 7.7 H7.7-C refutation (executive alignment hypothesis refuted, operating committee absent per Stage 4.1 enabling executive information silos). Customer satisfaction contradiction: Operations executives operate without satisfaction measurement (internal void), brand executives operate on 'Fanatical Support' claim, external reality 'consistently worse' 2024 per Trustpilot—executives operate on contradictory satisfaction realities without reconciliation. Customer count contradiction: Finance executives report external count, sales executives size territories on different count, operations executives track on CRM count—executives use divergent counts without canonical reconciliation. Data quality contradiction: Executives trust CRM data for material decisions (territory sizing, compensation, pipeline reviews) while simultaneously knowing CRM 13-15% inaccurate—dual standard enables velocity (trust operationally) while managing skepticism (adjust downstream). Stage 7.7 coherence assessment concludes CONTRADICTORY—contradictions structural, persistent across three CEO tenures, serving organizational purposes (velocity, autonomy, accountability avoidance) outweighing coherence benefits."
