      "what_breaks_if_touched": "Sales velocity slows (delivery validation T0-T1 adds days/weeks to sales cycle), compensation disputes (commission clawback if bookings adjusted), sales culture resistance (accuracy discipline conflicts with velocity priority), requires cross-functional coordination infrastructure absent (operating committee, delivery CRM access, validation authority rebalancing)",
