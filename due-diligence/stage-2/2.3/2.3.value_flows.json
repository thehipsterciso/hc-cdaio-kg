CRITICAL: Value is SPLIT - hyperscaler provides infrastructure (billed as pass-through), Rackspace provides human expertise layer (management fee).

        "PROVISIONING: Infrastructure blueprint becomes live running environment. APIs automate but human validation required (security review, cost estimation, customer acceptance). Provisioning errors create rework loops.",

REALIZATION FRICTION: If customer perceives low value from management layer (slow ticket response, no proactive optimization, generic support), they compare management fee to ZERO cost of hyperscaler-direct relationship.
