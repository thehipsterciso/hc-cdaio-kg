Both financially impossible with current $709M SG&A constraint and thin margins. IF FORCED TO RESOLVE TO 'DECLINE': Would require acknowledging business is in managed decline/harvest mode. Kills employee morale (talent exodus), damages customer confidence (accelerates churn as customers perceive 'sunset' provider), eliminates M&A attractiveness (who acquires dying MSP?), triggers debt covenant concerns (lenders uncomfortable with declining borrower). ACTUAL RESOLUTION: Contradiction already ACTIVE and unresolvable - business is experiencing death spiral (21% net leakage) while marketing growth narrative (14% bookings).

Requires: (1) Shutting down entity operations (exit Government or UK Sovereign), (2) Massive headcount reductions (1,500-2,000 FTE cuts from 5,100 total), (3) Potentially delisting (go private) to eliminate public company overhead.

Starve Public Cloud and SMB of investment (minimal retention, no feature development, skeleton support). Public Cloud and SMB churn accelerates from 15-40% to potentially 30-60% as service quality degrades. Lose $955-1,370M revenue (35-50% of total) over 2-3 years.

IF OPTIMIZE FOR REVENUE SCALE: Would require investing in Public Cloud and SMB to reduce churn and drive growth. Spend retention dollars on low-margin, high-churn segments (low ROI). Underinvest in Private Cloud (accelerates -13% YoY decline) and Government (risks compliance or service issues). Profit contribution from Private Cloud/Government erodes, overall profitability declines. Business becomes larger but less profitable (growing unprofitable).

IF MAINTAIN MONTH-TO-MONTH: Fixed costs remain vulnerable to rapid revenue loss. Top 20 customers (estimated 25-40% of revenue) could exit in 3-6 months with 30-60 day notice, creating $685M-1,095M revenue loss while costs remain fixed. $709M SG&A becomes 40-60% of remaining revenue (financially distressed). ACTUAL RESOLUTION: Contradiction is BAKED IN - month-to-month billing was customer acquisition strategy that succeeded in winning customers but created existential vulnerability. Cannot reverse without triggering exit wave. Business must accept permanent vulnerability to rapid revenue loss with no contractual protection.
