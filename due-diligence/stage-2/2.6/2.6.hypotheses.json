(4) $715M GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT proves value destruction from acquisitions.

Original simple model (SMB email/hosting, owned infrastructure, single entity) was economically coherent - current complex model is incoherent.

IMPLICATION: Management either: (A) UNAWARE of contradictions (incompetence - don't understand own business model), OR (B) AWARE but CONCEALING (deliberately marketing narrative to investors/customers while knowing reality is different), OR (C) COGNITIVELY DISSONANT (believe narrative despite contradicting evidence). All three scenarios indicate MANAGEMENT FAILURE to address business model incoherence. Narrative mismatch prevents honest assessment and resolution of contradictions - cannot fix what you won't acknowledge broken."
