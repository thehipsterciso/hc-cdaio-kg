Margin compression evident: Overall gross margin 19.5% down from 21.3% YoY (180bps compression), with Public Cloud as 61% of revenue driving majority of deterioration.

Even if Rackspace passes through 50% to customers (remainder absorbed), margin compresses by 5-10 percentage points, (3) UNDERINVESTMENT IN CAPEX: CapEx declined 25% ($181M to $136M) while revenue declined only 13%, suggesting Rackspace is STARVING Private Cloud of infrastructure refresh investment to preserve cash. Aging infrastructure creates: higher maintenance costs (margin erosion), performance degradation (customer churn), competitive disadvantage. DEATH SPIRAL: Revenue decline → margin compression → underinvestment → service degradation → more churn. Private Cloud was Rackspace's MARGIN ENGINE (38.6% vs 10.4% Public Cloud) but is now FASTEST DECLINING segment (-13% YoY), destroying profitability mix. If Private Cloud declines from 39% to 30% of revenue mix while Public Cloud stays at 61-70%, overall gross margin compresses from 19.5% toward 15% (Public Cloud's low margin dominates mix).",

T&M engagements have utilization risk - unbilled time is margin loss, (3) COMPETITIVE BIDDING: Professional services are often loss-leaders to win managed services ARR. Rackspace may accept low/zero margin on migrations to capture recurring revenue. BOOKINGS GROWTH 14% YoY suggests strong pipeline, but conversion to high-margin ARR is UNKNOWN. If professional services bookings are primarily low-margin project work (not converting to recurring managed services), bookings growth is FALSE SIGNAL of health.
