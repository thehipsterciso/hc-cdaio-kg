(2) Segment analysis: Stage 2.3 Email maintained relationships until price forced exit (inertia not loyalty), Stage 2.4 documents retention as 'STRUCTURAL not earned through superior service', explicit statement that loyalty is low. (3) Historical M&A: Stage 2.6 Datapipe and Onica acquisitions resulted in goodwill impairments (integration failures), if Rackspace had strong customer loyalty would successfully cross-sell to acquired base, failures suggest transactional relationships.
