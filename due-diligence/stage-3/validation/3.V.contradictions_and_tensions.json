      "why_it_matters": "Creates management illusion of stability while business deteriorates. If renewal rates HIGH and churn LOW, revenue should be stable or growing. Mathematical inconsistency proves retained customers are shrinking spend, downsizing services, or negotiating discounts - retention metrics MASK revenue erosion. Traditional churn-based forecasting will dramatically underestimate business decline. Indicates constraint-based retention (customers trapped but unhappy) not loyalty-based retention (customers choosing to stay and expand).",

If $2-10M switching costs and 12-27 month timelines are insufficient to prevent decline, demonstrates that: (1) economic pressures eventually overwhelm switching cost barriers, (2) trigger events (VMware pricing, hyperscaler incentives, modernization mandates) make switching costs justifiable as investments, (3) 'protection' from switching costs is temporary illusion not permanent moat. Suggests low-switching-cost segments (SMB, Mid-Market Public Cloud) facing catastrophic vulnerability if high-switching-cost segments already declining.",

      "why_it_matters": "Reveals disconnect between positioning and market reality. If service differentiation effective, should command premium pricing and above-average margins. Commodity margins prove market does NOT value differentiation or customers unwilling/unable to pay for it. Creates strategic confusion - company invests in service quality (cost) but cannot monetize through pricing (no revenue benefit), worst possible combination. Suggests either: (1) differentiation is perceived not real (customers don't experience meaningful difference), (2) differentiation is real but non-valued (customers want commodity service at commodity prices), or (3) competitive dynamics prevent monetization (hyperscaler alternatives force commodity pricing regardless of quality).
