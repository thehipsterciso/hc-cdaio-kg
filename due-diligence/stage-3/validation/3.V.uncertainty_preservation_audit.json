      "CRITICAL UNKNOWNS (decision-determinative): (1) Debt covenant structure and headroom - determines bankruptcy timeline under recession shock (6-12 months vs 18-24 months critically different). (2) VMware contract price protection provisions - determines if/when additional 50-100% increases possible (immediate crisis vs 2-3 year window). (3) Hyperscaler partner credit levels and trajectory - determines Public Cloud margin sustainability (if currently 15% vs 10% vs 5% = completely different viability assessments). (4) Apollo investment basis and exit requirements - determines harvest mode intensity and strategic investment feasibility.",
      "MATERIAL UNKNOWNS (significantly affect analysis): (1) Hyperscaler systematic vs opportunistic MSP targeting - affects Mid-Market churn rate estimates ($40M vs $110M at risk, 2-3 year vs 4-5 year timeline). (2) Historical recession performance 2008-2009 and 2020 - would calibrate shock magnitude estimates (are 20-30% churn assumptions conservative or aggressive?). (3) Marketplace revenue percentage and growth - affects margin impact timeline (currently 15-30%, growing how fast to 50-70%?). (4) Customer procurement preferences and AI adoption pace - affects multiple shock scenario timelines.",
      "ACKNOWLEDGED THROUGHOUT: All sub-stages (3.1-3.6) include explicit uncertainty registers and unknowns requests. Estimates clearly labeled as INFERENCE vs FACT. Ranges provided rather than point estimates (partner credits 10-15% not '12.5%', latent churn $200-500M not '$350M'). Scenario-based analysis used where uncertainty high (optimistic/base/pessimistic cases for partner credits, systematic/opportunistic cases for hyperscaler targeting). Multiple sub-stages note 'WITHOUT DATA: assume PESSIMISTIC case' appropriately treating unknowns as risks not opportunities."

      "FUTURE COMPETITOR BEHAVIOR (fundamentally unpredictable): Whether hyperscalers will systematically target MSP customers vs remain opportunistic - strategic decision internal to AWS/Azure/Google, cannot be known until executed. When AI tools achieve mainstream adoption (2026? 2027? 2028?) - depends on product quality, customer adoption curves, competitive dynamics. Whether Broadcom continues VMware price escalations or stabilizes - depends on Broadcom's extraction vs retention strategy trade-offs.",
      "MACRO/GEOPOLITICAL EVENTS (inherently uncertain): Recession timing and magnitude - depends on Fed policy, geopolitical events, financial system stability. Capital markets reopening for PE exits - depends on interest rates, M&A market conditions, credit availability. Pace of data sovereignty mandate proliferation - depends on geopolitical tensions, regulatory philosophy, domestic political pressures in multiple jurisdictions. US-China decoupling trajectory - depends on great power competition evolution over decades.",
      "CUSTOMER BEHAVIOR UNDER STRESS (probabilistic not deterministic): How many customers justify switching costs as investments when VMware pricing deteriorates further? What percentage of Mid-Market adopts AI tools enabling insourcing vs stays with MSPs? Which customers churn first in recession (adverse selection outcomes)? Whether constraint-based retention breaks linearly or non-linearly when triggered? These are DISTRIBUTIONS not point predictions, inherently contain irreducible uncertainty.",
      "APPROPRIATELY TREATED: Analysis does NOT claim to predict these un-knowables. Instead: (1) Identifies un-knowables explicitly as uncertainty, (2) Analyzes CONDITIONAL scenarios (IF hyperscalers target systematically THEN $80-110M at risk, IF opportunistic THEN $40-70M at risk), (3) Assesses structural constraints making some outcomes more likely than others (constraint-based retention LIKELY breaks non-linearly based on Email precedent, but timing uncertain), (4) Uses sensitivity analysis showing outcome ranges under different un-knowable resolutions."
