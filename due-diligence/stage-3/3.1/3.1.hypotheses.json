DISCONFIRMING EVIDENCE NOT FOUND: Searched for MSP-hyperscaler long-term agreements with credit guarantees - NONE disclosed in public filings or industry reporting. Searched for evidence of MSP pricing power - email price increase failure is COUNTER-EVIDENCE proving hypothesis. Searched for MSP value capture parity - found 20-30X profit asymmetry per customer spend ($0.55-0.65 hyperscaler profit vs $0.02-0.03 MSP profit per $100 customer spend per Stage 2.5). CONCLUSION: Hypothesis STRONGLY SUPPORTED. Hyperscalers exercise unilateral pricing power, MSPs are price takers."

DISCONFIRMING EVIDENCE NOT FOUND: Searched for MSP margin expansion trends - found consistent compression across industry per public MSP financial disclosures. Searched for hyperscaler managed services failures - AWS MS and Azure MS both expanding not contracting per hyperscaler earnings calls.

Value migration from MSPs to hyperscalers is documented and ongoing, driven by hyperscaler strategic intent and customer capability maturation."

DISCONFIRMING EVIDENCE NOT FOUND: Searched for successful price increases in low-lock-in segments - email increase is COUNTER-EVIDENCE. Searched for uniform margins across segments - found 28 percentage point spread confirming hypothesis. Searched for contractual lock-in - found month-to-month billing is universal per Stage 2.2. CONCLUSION: Hypothesis STRONGLY SUPPORTED. Pricing power exists ONLY where operational/technical switching costs create customer captivity."
