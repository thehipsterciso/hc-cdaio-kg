Fanatical Support provides NONE of these: (1) Support quality is SUBSTITUTABLE (adequate support available from hyperscalers, commodity MSPs, internal teams at lower cost), (2) Support is COMPLEMENT to infrastructure not PRIMARY VALUE (customers buy infrastructure, support is secondary consideration), (3) Infrastructure/platform/cost DOMINATE purchasing decisions (Stage 3.3 shows customers choosing hyperscaler-direct for capabilities and cost despite Rackspace support superiority).

Switching costs measure DIFFICULTY of leaving (time, cost, risk), NOT WILLINGNESS to pay more (value perception, alternatives). HIGH SWITCHING COSTS + LOW PRICING POWER = customers are TRAPPED not LOYAL (would leave if could, stay because can't = zero pricing flexibility). Email segment PROVES this: customers had BEHAVIORAL INERTIA (low switching costs but high inattention = retention), attempted price increase BROKE inertia instantly, customers overcame behavioral barrier when price attention forced. Similarly, Large Enterprise has HIGH switching costs ($2-10M, 12-24 months) but VMware pricing analysis (Stage 3.3) shows customers WILL overcome costs when ongoing price increases justify investment (switching cost is ONE-TIME, price increase is RECURRING = economics favor switch at 2-5 year payback).",

Long tenure WITHOUT expansion (customer spending flat/declining) indicates STAGNATION not loyalty (customer maintaining minimum viable relationship, not deepening commitment). Stage 3.3 false loyalty signals analysis shows long tenure can indicate 'too expensive to leave' rather than 'too valuable to leave' - customers persist due to cost of switching, not value of staying.

Government customers face 12-27 month procurement cycles (Stage 2.4) making switching SLOW and BUREAUCRATIC, but procurement friction does NOT reduce customer SENSITIVITY to pricing or ABILITY to eventually switch. CRITICAL MISREAD: procurement delays are PROTECTIVE in short-term (customers can't switch quickly, revenue appears stable) but are VULNERABILITY in long-term (delayed switching means customer dissatisfaction ACCUMULATES, when procurement eventually completes the switch is CERTAIN not prevented, procurement cycle enables customers to BUILD BUSINESS CASE over 12-27 months making switch inevitable). Government procurement actually INCREASES price sensitivity (public sector scrutiny, audit requirements, taxpayer accountability = must justify costs) vs decreases it. Compliance requirements don't create pricing power because: (1) MULTIPLE PROVIDERS meet compliance (AWS GovCloud, Azure Government, Google Cloud for Government all FedRAMP authorized per Stage 3.2), Rackspace compliance is NOT unique, (2) Hyperscaler compliance alternatives have SUPERIOR CAPABILITIES at LOWER or SIMILAR pricing (Stage 3.2 competitive analysis), compliance requirement does not eliminate competition.",
