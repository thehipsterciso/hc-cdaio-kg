Private Cloud revenue declines from $1,055M (Stage 2.1) to $300-500M over 5 years (60-75% revenue loss). BREAKS: (1) SEGMENT ECONOMICS - Private Cloud has HIGH FIXED COSTS (data center infrastructure, VMware licenses, specialized staff), losing 60% of revenue while fixed costs remain creates MASSIVE LOSSES, estimated -20% to -40% EBITDA margins on remaining $300-500M base (losing $60-200M annually), (2) STRATEGIC PORTFOLIO - Private Cloud currently contributes 40-50% of operating income (Stage 2.4), elimination creates $300-400M operating income hole, remaining segments (Public Cloud low-margin, Government small-scale) insufficient to cover $709M SG&A, company becomes loss-making, (3) CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS - enterprises modernizing applications RARELY maintain split infrastructure (some Private Cloud, some Public Cloud), typically COMPLETE MIGRATION to hyperscaler-direct for operational simplicity, Private Cloud customers who modernize 50-70% of workloads likely migrate remaining 30-50% shortly after for consistency, actual churn likely 70-85% not 50-70%, (4) TALENT AND INVESTMENT - cannot justify maintaining Private Cloud business unit for $300-500M declining revenue, must either EXIT segment entirely (write off data center investments, workforce reductions) or STARVE investment accepting terminal decline (no modernization, no competitiveness, death spiral). OUTCOME: Private Cloud segment ELIMINATED over 5-7 year cloud-native transition, Rackspace becomes $800-900M company (Public Cloud $690M + Government $127M) with margins insufficient to support $709M SG&A overhead, company-wide RESTRUCTURING or EXIT required.",

      "recovery_constraints": "GEOPOLITICAL FRAGMENTATION IS ONE-WAY RATCHET - regulatory restrictions escalate over time, rarely reverse, technology ecosystems diverge permanently (US-aligned stack vs China-aligned stack), reunification structurally impossible. SCALE DISADVANTAGE AMPLIFIES: Hyperscalers have resources to maintain fully redundant operations in fragmented geopolitical zones (AWS $100B+ revenue, Azure $80B+ revenue can afford $10-20B geopolitical complexity investments), Rackspace $1.38B revenue cannot maintain duplicate technology stacks, must choose markets and lose others. CUSTOMER PREFERENCE FOR SCALE: Multinational enterprises prefer vendors who can navigate geopolitical complexity transparently (hyperscalers), avoid vendors who might face disruptions or restrictions (Rackspace scale-limited), geopolitical uncertainty drives customers to LARGER providers. NO COMPETITIVE MOAT: Unlike sovereignty regulations where Rackspace could theoretically gain advantage through early compliance, geopolitical restrictions create NO ADVANTAGE for Rackspace (restrictions affect all US providers equally, scale determines navigation ability), only DISADVANTAGE (scale constraints limit response options). Recovery requires: Geopolitical tensions de-escalating (unlikely given US-China strategic competition), OR Rackspace achieving scale to navigate complexity (impossible given current trajectory), OR customers accepting geopolitical risk from subscale provider (contradicts risk-management logic). No recovery path exists.",
      "touch_test_what_breaks": "US-CHINA DECOUPLING ACCELERATES with semiconductor equipment bans + software export restrictions + cloud services restrictions: Rackspace faces: (1) Must choose between US operations or China operations (cannot maintain both due to regulatory separation requirements), choosing US loses $20-50M China-related revenue, choosing China loses $1.3B+ US revenue, obvious choice but still painful, (2) Chinese-owned customers ($20-50M estimated) proactively exit Rackspace due to concerns about US regulatory risk, prefer China-based providers or hyperscalers with China-independent operations, (3) Multinational enterprises reevaluate Rackspace for global operations, 30-40% of multinational base ($60-120M estimated) migrate to hyperscalers for geopolitical risk reduction, (4) Supply chain costs inflate 15-30% from export licensing and alternative sourcing ($20-40M annual cost increase on hardware/software procurement), margins compressed further. BREAKS: (1) REVENUE LOSS - combined impact of direct China exit ($20-50M), Chinese-owned customer churn ($20-50M), and multinational migration ($60-120M) = $100-220M revenue at risk (7-16% of base), accelerates decline from -7% YoY currently to -15% to -20% YoY, (2) MARGIN COMPRESSION - supply chain inflation adds $20-40M annual costs cannot be passed through to customers (Stage 3.4 proves zero pricing power), margins decline from 3.1% EBITDA to ZERO or negative, (3) STRATEGIC POSITIONING - geopolitical fragmentation demonstrates Rackspace SCALE DISADVANTAGE vs hyperscalers (AWS/Azure navigate complexity, Rackspace cannot), reinforces customer perception of Rackspace as subscale vendor unsuitable for global enterprise, (4) CUSTOMER CONFIDENCE - high-stakes compliance environments (Government, regulated industries) especially concerned about vendor geopolitical risk, proactive churn from risk-averse segments. OUTCOME: Geopolitical shock accelerates EXISTING DECLINE TRAJECTORY by 5-10 percentage points annually, compounds with other pressures (VMware, commoditization, AI) to create TERMINAL VELOCITY decline likely reaching bankruptcy/restructuring 12-24 months faster than without geopolitical shock.",
