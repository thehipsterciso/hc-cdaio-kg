    "Searched for evidence that Rackspace successfully absorbed major vendor cost increases without passing to customers - FOUND: VMware 200-300% increase PARTIALLY transmitted causing customer churn, Email business economics failures transmitted via 706% pricing causing collapse, indicates transmission not absorption pattern",
    "Searched for evidence that Rackspace maintained margins during recession periods - LIMITED DATA: Company private during 2008-2009 recession, 2020 COVID period saw temporary demand but also structural shifts, no clear evidence of margin preservation during major downturns",
    "Searched for evidence that customers return to Rackspace after switching to competitors during stress - NOT FOUND: No documented cases of significant customer cohort returning after switching to hyperscaler-direct or competitors, switching appears one-way",
    "Searched for evidence of financial reserves or credit facilities enabling shock buffering - NOT FOUND: PE ownership (Stage 1.5) typically uses leverage reducing reserves, no public disclosure of credit capacity, 3.1% EBITDA suggests minimal cash reserves",
    "Searched for evidence that sovereignty/compliance creates sustainable competitive moats - CONTRADICTED: AWS UK Sovereign launch (Stage 3.2) demonstrates hyperscalers will invest in compliance when justified, ~100 FedRAMP providers (Stage 3.2) shows compliance doesn't create exclusivity, temporary advantage only",
    "Searched for evidence that high switching costs protected customers during VMware pricing shock - CONTRADICTED: Stage 3.3 documents $90-150M Private Cloud revenue at latent churn risk DESPITE $2-10M switching costs, switching costs delayed not prevented churn",
    "Searched for evidence of SG&A flexibility despite fragmentation - CONTRADICTED: Stage 2.2 shows only 12% headcount reduction vs 7% revenue decline, Stage 1.5 documents permanent fragmentation preventing consolidation, cost flexibility structurally limited",
    "Searched for evidence that AI automation tools would increase rather than decrease MSP demand - NOT FOUND: No credible scenarios where AI tools increasing cloud complexity create MORE MSP need vs democratizing expertise REDUCING MSP need, technology trend unidirectional toward automation",
    "Searched for evidence of MSP industry recovery after historical recessions - MIXED: Industry consolidated after 2001 and 2008 recessions with share shifting to larger players, smaller MSPs exited, Rackspace scale-constrained vs hyperscalers suggesting adverse position in future recession",
    "Searched for evidence that geopolitical decoupling would reverse or moderate - NOT FOUND: US-China strategic competition intensifying 2018-2025 with bipartisan US political consensus, no credible scenarios for near-term reversal, decoupling appears permanent or generational timeframe"
