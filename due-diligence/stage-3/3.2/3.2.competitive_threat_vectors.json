Hyperscalers damage Rackspace through: (1) DIRECT CUSTOMER SOLICITATION - hyperscaler account teams can directly approach Rackspace customers offering to eliminate MSP markup (10-15% cost reduction), providing migration incentives (credits, free consulting, discounted first-year pricing), (2) MANAGEMENT LAYER SUBSTITUTION - customers keep same applications, data, and infrastructure configuration, only change who manages/monitors/supports (low risk migration), (3) INTEGRATED ADVANTAGE - hyperscaler-direct managed services offer deeper platform integration, faster access to new features, unified support vs third-party MSP coordination friction, (4) SUBSIDIZED PRICING - hyperscalers can price direct managed services below MSP cost structure (subsidize management to capture infrastructure consumption long-term, cross-subsidize from other services), (5) BRAND TRUST TRANSFER - customers already trust AWS/Azure/Google for infrastructure, extending trust to management services reduces MSP relationship value.
