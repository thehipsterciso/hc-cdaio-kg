      "priority": "CRITICAL",
      "unknown_addressed": "Attrition rates, turnover patterns, and workforce stability in heroic execution zones",
      "specific_request": "(1) Turnover data by function: Support staff annual voluntary turnover rate (last 3 years), operations/security team turnover, delivery team turnover, sales organization turnover (post-refresh Q3 2024), executive/senior leadership turnover beyond CEO (C-suite, VP level), (2) Turnover attribution: Exit interview data—how many cite workload, burnout, coordination overhead, unsustainable pace?, regrettable vs non-regrettable turnover breakdown, internal promotion rate vs external hiring (indicator of bench strength), (3) Recruitment health: Time-to-fill for critical roles (CEO, VP-level, jurisdiction specialists, senior engineers), offer acceptance rate (recruiting competitiveness), recruiting pipeline health by role, (4) Workforce stability indicators: Tenure distribution by function (concentration of <1yr, 1-3yr, 3-5yr, 5+yr), retention of high performers vs low performers, flight risk assessment (key individuals at risk of departure)",
      "why_material": "Cannot quantify talent stability risk or predict death spiral timeline without turnover data. Need to assess whether heroics-driven attrition hypothesis supported by actual data. Critical for determining intervention urgency—if attrition accelerating in heroic zones, immediate action required. Essential for retention strategy—which roles have highest flight risk? Critical for feasibility assessment—if attrition rate high and recruitment difficult, structural reforms may fail due to insufficient talent capacity to implement."

      "specific_request": "(1) Documentation completeness audit: Operations runbook coverage assessment (what percentage of operational procedures documented vs tribal?), legacy system documentation inventory (architecture, configuration, procedures, vendor integrations), incident response runbook completeness by incident type (ransomware, zero-day, common failure modes), support cross-functional coordination procedures (is 'dozens of engineers' coordination path documented?), multi-jurisdictional deployment procedures by jurisdiction, (2) Key person risk assessment: Which specific individuals/roles possess critical undocumented knowledge?, what happens if each key person unavailable (vacation, illness, departure)?, knowledge concentration score by area (1 person knows = high risk, team knowledge = lower risk), (3) Knowledge transfer feasibility: How long to train replacement in each critical role?, can tribal knowledge be documented or is complexity irreducible?, knowledge transfer success history (past transitions smooth or chaotic?)",
      "why_material": "Cannot assess turnover impact severity without understanding knowledge concentration. Need to determine whether smooth succession possible with documentation effort or turnover inherently catastrophic. Critical for business continuity planning—which key person departures would create operational crisis? Essential for prioritizing documentation efforts—where is knowledge concentration risk highest? Critical for acquisition planning—if acquirer integrates, how long does knowledge transfer to acquirer teams require? If months/years, valuation impact material."

      "specific_request": "(1) Workforce health metrics: Employee engagement survey data (burnout indicators, workload satisfaction, intent to stay, recommend employer to friend?), stress-related health metrics if available (absence patterns, disability claims, wellness program utilization), overtime and extended hours patterns by function (which teams operating at heroic levels continuously?), on-call rotation sustainability (are rotations adequate or extended beyond healthy limits?), (2) Capacity utilization assessment: What percentage of teams operating at sustainable vs heroic capacity levels?, manager assessment of team sustainability (can teams maintain current pace? For how long—months, quarters, years?), workload vs headcount trends (is workload increasing faster than headcount?), (3) Near-miss indicators: Error rates or quality metrics indicating capacity stress, incident frequency trends (are incidents increasing suggesting capacity degradation?), customer complaint trends (are complaints accelerating indicating service degradation from capacity stress?), project delays or execution failures from capacity constraints",
      "why_material": "Cannot assess intervention urgency without understanding burnout severity. Need to determine whether heroics sustainable for extended period (quarters/years) allowing time for structural reform, or at breaking point requiring immediate intervention. Critical for predicting failure mode—does capacity degrade gradually (early warning possible) or collapse suddenly (catastrophic failure risk)? Essential for workforce planning—how much capacity available for transformation initiatives vs consumed by operational heroics? Critical for acquisition—if workforce at breaking point, integration stress may trigger mass attrition."

If BU Presidents granted cross-functional authority, will they coordinate effectively or recreate coordination failures at distributed level? If VP Support created, will support leader successfully compel cross-functional action? Critical for build vs buy decision—develop internal leaders' capability or recruit external proven leaders? Essential for reform sequencing—must capability development precede authority delegation or can delegation enable learning? Critical for implementation timeline—if capability exists, reforms can proceed quickly; if capability development required, extended timeline."

Engineering resist operations stability authority?), receptivity to incentive changes (will sales accept profitability-based comp? Support accept resolution-based metrics?), receptivity to governance creation (operating committee, deal review board—seen as helpful or bureaucratic?), (3) Reform investment capacity: Capital available for transformation within debt constraints ($1.3B debt), leadership bandwidth for change management (can existing leaders manage business continuity AND transformation simultaneously?), reform prioritization—which reforms most critical and which prerequisite for others?, reform timeline estimate—months? Quarters? Years?",
