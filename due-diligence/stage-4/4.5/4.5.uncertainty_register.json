Inferred support staff attrition from customer satisfaction decline (Trustpilot 'consistently worse' 2024) and heroics dependency ('dozens of engineers' coordination BBB)—but actual turnover rate unknown. Inferred operations team burnout risk from multi-month sustained crises (ransomware, zero-day)—but actual attrition unknown. Cannot assess whether turnover accelerating or stable. Cannot determine death spiral timeline—how quickly heroics-driven attrition compounds? Cannot prioritize retention interventions—which roles have highest attrition risk requiring immediate action? Cannot model talent availability—if attrition rate X%, can organization recruit replacements at sustainable rate or does backlog accumulate?",

Inferred support coordination knowledge tribal from informal 'dozens of engineers' coordination—but what percentage of procedures documented vs tribal? Cannot assess turnover impact severity—if key custodian departs, how long until replacement achieves competence? Weeks? Months? Years?

Cannot determine intervention urgency—are heroic zones sustainable for months? Quarters? Years? Or already at breaking point?

For how long?), near-miss incident analysis (errors or failures indicating capacity stress), overtime and on-call rotation sustainability (extended hours patterns indicating unsustainable load), succession risk assessment (how many critical roles have viable successors?)"

Talent stability at risk during acquisition: Key talent may depart pre-close (uncertainty drives attrition), acquirer may eliminate roles (redundancy to acquirer capabilities), integration may create additional heroics demand (parallel legacy and acquirer systems). Cannot plan talent retention or structural reform without knowing integration approach. Investment in pre-close structural reform risky—may be wasted if acquirer replaces systems. But failure to reform may reduce value—acquirer values stable business not talent-dependent fragility.",

Can model scenarios: (1) Full integration—talent retention plan for key individuals during transition, knowledge transfer to acquirer teams, structural reforms low priority (acquirer systems replace), (2) Standalone—structural reforms critical, talent retention essential, organizational stability premium value driver, (3) Asset carve-out—talent retention in retained assets only, structural reforms scoped to retained business. Can conduct talent flight risk assessment: Which key individuals likely to depart pre-close (CEO uncertainty, heroics zones, market-attractive skills)? Can develop retention strategy by scenario: What retention mechanisms by integration approach?"
