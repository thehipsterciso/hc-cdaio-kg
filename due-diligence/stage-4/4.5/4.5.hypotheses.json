Operations respond to incidents heroically because prevention structurally unfunded—more talented operations staff would inherit same reactive-only posture. Hypothesis: Adding talented individuals addresses symptom (execution failure) not cause (structural constraint). System reform necessary—talent optimization insufficient."

Disproportionate impact because: Knowledge concentrated not distributed (tribal), coordination informal not systematized (personal relationships), expertise scarce not fungible (jurisdiction specialists), succession infrastructure absent (no knowledge transfer process).

Each new CEO likely attracted by leadership opportunity and compensation, but structural overload (coordination bottleneck, no governance infrastructure) defeats individual capability. Similar pattern inferred for support staff: Initially attracted by 'Fanatical Support' brand promise, discover heroic informal coordination required continuously, burn out and depart. Operations teams likely experiencing similar cycle: Attracted by technical challenge and incident response opportunity, sustaining multi-month crises reveals reactive-only posture unsustainable, attrition during/after major incidents. Hypothesis: Heroic zones attract capable ambitious individuals initially but burn them out through structural unsustainability, creating churn in most critical roles. Death spiral: Heroics requirement drives attrition, attrition increases heroics burden on remaining staff, accelerates additional attrition. Talent trap because no amount of individual capability can overcome structural constraint requiring sustained heroics."
