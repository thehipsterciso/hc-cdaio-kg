Inferred sales compensated on bookings (not profitability), support measured on SLA (not resolution), operations measured on incident response (not prevention)—but specific formulas, weightings, thresholds unknown. Cannot assess incentive reform complexity: How many compensation structures need changing? How entrenched are measurement systems? What data infrastructure required for outcome-based measurement?

Create Customer Success organization? Grant support authority to compel cross-functional action? Each has different coordination costs. Cross-functional coordination void: Grant BU Presidents authority matching accountability? Create operating committee? Maintain CEO coordination but add capacity?

But cannot predict which scenario until acquirer identified and integration approach negotiated. Pre-close reform investment decision must consider scenario probabilities and value at risk in each scenario."
