      "hypothesis_tested": "H4.4-A: Incentive misalignment drives execution failure more than capability deficits",
      "disconfirming_evidence_sought": "Execution failures from capability/skill deficits rather than incentive misalignment, Activity and outcome metrics aligned, Proactive incentive reforms addressing root causes",
      "search_conducted": "Examined execution failure patterns for capability deficit evidence: Sales organization size (400+ reps—capacity exists), support engineering capacity ('dozens of engineers' per BBB—capacity exists), operations incident response capability (multi-month ransomware response—capability exists). Searched for activity/outcome metric alignment: SLA vs satisfaction, bookings vs margins, ticket processing vs resolution. Searched for proactive incentive reforms: Compensation structure changes, measurement system overhauls, incentive realignment initiatives.",
      "evidence_found": "NONE disconfirming. Execution failures occur despite capacity: Sales 400+ reps but margins eroding (capacity not constraint), support 'dozens of engineers' but satisfaction declining (capacity not constraint), operations incident response capable but incidents recurring (capacity not constraint). Activity/outcome divergence consistent: SLA met/satisfaction down, bookings maintained/margins down, tickets processed/issues unresolved. No proactive incentive reforms found: Sales refresh Q3 2024 changed personnel not compensation structure, walk away policy Q4 2024 reactive CEO enforcement not incentive realignment, no evidence of measurement system overhaul (still measuring SLA, bookings, incident response).",
      "conclusion": "Disconfirming evidence NOT FOUND. Execution failures consistently show capacity exists but incentive misdirects effort. Activity/outcome divergence pattern pervasive. Interventions treat symptoms (personnel changes, reactive policies) not incentive root cause. Hypothesis remains supported."

      "disconfirming_evidence_sought": "Execution failures from individual performance rather than accountability voids, Authority-accountability alignment evidence, Void resolution through structural reform, Successful autonomous execution without escalation",
      "search_conducted": "Examined execution failures for individual performance deficit attribution: Personnel changes as solutions (three CEOs, sales refresh), performance management indicators, individual capability assessments. Searched for authority-accountability alignment: Roles with unified responsibility and authority, successful coordination examples. Searched for structural void resolution: Governance infrastructure creation (operating committee, deal review board), authority reallocation initiatives. Searched for autonomous execution: Cross-functional coordination without CEO intervention or informal heroics.",
      "evidence_found": "NONE disconfirming. Personnel changes don't resolve execution failures: Three CEOs—bottleneck recreates (structural not individual), sales refresh Q3 2024—margin erosion continues (structural not individual). No authority-accountability alignment found: BU Presidents have P&L accountability without authority, support has satisfaction accountability without authority, sales has booking authority without profitability accountability. No structural void resolution found: No operating committee created (Stage 4.1), no deal review board, no empowered coordinator roles, no authority reallocation. No autonomous execution found: Cross-functional coordination requires CEO intervention (healthcare deal) or informal heroics (support 'dozens of engineers')—no successful repeatable process.",
      "conclusion": "Disconfirming evidence NOT FOUND. Accountability voids persist structurally across personnel changes. Authority-accountability misalignment pervasive. No structural reforms identified. Autonomous execution absent—coordination requires CEO/heroics workarounds. Hypothesis remains supported."

Searched for local/enterprise metric alignment: Cases where local optimization drives enterprise value, functions measured on enterprise outcomes. Searched for proactive enterprise optimization: Functions sacrificing local metrics for enterprise value, cross-functional trade-offs optimizing enterprise. Searched for enterprise-optimizing coordination: Cross-functional initiatives prioritizing enterprise outcomes.",
      "evidence_found": "NONE disconfirming. No enterprise optimization incentives found: Sales measured on bookings (local) not delivered profitability (enterprise), support measured on SLA (local) not customer satisfaction (enterprise), operations measured on incident response (local) not prevention (enterprise), finance measured on budget variance (local) not execution outcomes (enterprise). No local/enterprise alignment found: Consistent divergence—sales bookings maintained/margins eroding, SLA met/satisfaction declining, incidents responded/frequency increasing. No proactive enterprise optimization found: All enterprise interventions reactive (walk away policy, sales refresh) after crisis forces recognition. No enterprise-optimizing coordination: Cross-functional coordination driven by crisis not proactive enterprise value optimization.",
      "conclusion": "Disconfirming evidence NOT FOUND. All functions measured on local activities not enterprise outcomes. Local/enterprise divergence pattern pervasive. Enterprise optimization reactive (crisis-driven) not proactive. Cross-functional coordination absent except crisis response. Hypothesis remains supported."

      "search_conducted": "Examined impact of personnel changes on drag patterns: Three CEO transitions—did bottleneck resolve?, sales refresh Q3 2024—did margin erosion stop?, new leadership behavior vs predecessor behavior. Searched for cultural change initiatives: Values/culture programs, leadership development, organizational culture transformation efforts.

Drag patterns persist after personnel changes: Three CEOs (Jones, Maletira, Kandiah)—bottleneck recreates with each (Stage 4.2: CEO serial processing persists), sales refresh Q3 2024—margin erosion continues (Private Cloud -13%, Public Cloud -3% after refresh), walk away policy Q4 2024—requires ongoing CEO enforcement indicating behavior doesn't self-correct. No cultural change evidence found: No culture transformation initiatives mentioned, no leadership development programs addressing coordination/accountability, interventions focused on policy/personnel not culture. No behavior change without incentive change found: New personnel exhibit same patterns as predecessors under same incentive structure. No values-driven behavior found: No evidence of individuals sacrificing measured performance for enterprise value—behavior consistent with incentive optimization.",
      "conclusion": "Disconfirming evidence NOT FOUND. Personnel changes recreate drag patterns—indicates structural not individual issue. Cultural change initiatives absent. Behavior follows incentives consistently—new personnel exhibit same patterns as predecessors. Values/intrinsic motivation not overriding misaligned incentives. Hypothesis remains supported."
