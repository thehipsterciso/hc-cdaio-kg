      "hypothesis_tested": "H4.2-A: Coordination load constrains throughput more than functional capacity",
      "disconfirming_evidence_sought": "Evidence of throughput improving with headcount additions, streamlined coordination processes improving delivery speed, functional capacity constraints cited as primary bottleneck",
      "search_conducted": "Reviewed earnings calls for management commentary on capacity constraints vs coordination constraints. Searched for process improvement initiatives. Examined headcount trends vs throughput trends (layoffs vs revenue). Searched customer complaints for capacity issues vs coordination issues.",
      "evidence_found": "NONE disconfirming. Layoffs 2021, 2023 reduced headcount but throughput worsened (revenue -7% FY2024). Customer complaints cite coordination failures ('dozens of engineers, no ownership') not capacity shortages. No process improvement initiatives disclosed beyond layoffs and reorganizations.",

      "hypothesis_tested": "H4.2-B: Throughput degrades non-linearly with complexity",
      "disconfirming_evidence_sought": "Evidence of complex cross-functional work flowing at similar pace to simple work, large custom deals processing efficiently, multi-jurisdictional coordination not creating delays",

      "evidence_found": "NONE disconfirming. Major healthcare deal required CEO involvement—indicates complex deals cannot flow through standard process. Customer complaints about cross-functional issues stalling. Multi-jurisdictional operations require separate deployment per jurisdiction (5-6x multiplier).",

      "search_conducted": "Compared SLA response times (activity) vs customer satisfaction (outcome). Compared sales bookings (activity) vs revenue/margin (outcome). Compared ticket processing (activity) vs resolution rates (outcome). Searched management commentary acknowledging activity/outcome divergence.",
