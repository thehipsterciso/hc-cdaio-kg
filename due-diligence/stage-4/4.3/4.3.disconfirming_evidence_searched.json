      "evidence_found": "NONE disconfirming. Customer complaints cite coordination ('dozens of engineers, no ownership') not skill. Layoffs 2021, 2023 reduced capacity but throughput worsened—confirms coordination not capacity is constraint. No successful cross-functional coordination examples found. Reorganization 2023 created BU structure but authority gaps persist.",
