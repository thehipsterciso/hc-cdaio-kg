      "area": "Support staff absorbing customer coordination failures through heroics",
      "how_failure_is_absorbed": "Support engineers attempt to resolve cross-functional customer issues despite lacking authority to compel billing, delivery, engineering action. Engineers work across multiple tickets, communicate with 'dozens' of colleagues (per BBB), manually coordinate without formal process or authority. Support staff absorbs coordination failure through overtime, informal relationships, personal intervention—masking organizational authority gap. SLA response times met (15min/1hr/4hr) masking that resolution times unbounded for complex issues. Activity metrics (tickets processed) mask outcome metrics (customer satisfaction plummeting).",
      "why_it_is_dangerous": "Support staff burnout inevitable—cannot sustain heroics indefinitely. Informal coordination non-scalable—dependent on individual relationships not process. Failure masked from management—SLA metrics show 'green' while customer satisfaction degrades. When support staff churn/burnout occurs, informal coordination breaks completely—no process to fall back on. Customer complaints indicate pattern worsening ('consistently getting worse' Trustpilot 2024)—suggesting heroics failing to mask failure adequately.",
      "downstream_risk": "Support staff attrition creates coordination collapse—informal networks dissolve. Customer churn accelerates as heroics capacity depleted. Management unaware of severity—SLA metrics misleading. Crisis emerges suddenly when heroics capacity exhausted—appears as sudden degradation but actually long-masked structural failure. Post-close integration amplifies risk—integration disrupts informal networks, heroics cannot scale to increased load.",

      "area": "Delivery teams absorbing sales-delivery coordination failures through rework and margin erosion",
      "how_failure_is_absorbed": "Delivery teams attempt to execute deals sales booked without profitability review. When discovers unprofitability/unbuildability, delivery absorbs failure by: (1) Executing poorly within sold constraints eroding margin, (2) Reworking deals post-signature consuming capacity, (3) Under-resourcing unprofitable customers to preserve capacity for profitable ones, (4) Sacrificing quality/speed to meet impossible commitments. Delivery absorbs sales coordination failure through margin erosion (Private Cloud -13%, Public Cloud -3%) rather than refusing to execute. Masks sales-delivery authority mismatch from visibility until financial deterioration forces CEO intervention (Q4 2024 'walk away' policy).",
      "how_failure_is_absorbed": "Delivery teams attempt to execute deals sales booked without profitability review. When unprofitability/unbuildability discovered, delivery absorbs failure through: Margin erosion (executing unprofitably), Rework (post-signature deal modifications), Customer execution failures (poor delivery), Capacity consumption (unprofitable customers consume resources). Delivery absorbs sales authority failure rather than refusing execution—masks coordination breakdown until financial deterioration severe (margins -13%/-3%, revenue -7% FY2024) forcing CEO intervention Q4 2024.",
      "why_it_is_dangerous": "Margin erosion compounds—each unprofitable deal destroys value. Delivery capacity consumed by unprofitable customers—less available for profitable ones. Customer execution failures create churn—compounds revenue decline. Failure masked from sales organization—sales continues booking unprofitable deals until CEO intervenes. Sales 'refresh' Q3 2024 indicates personnel changes required—suggests masking allowed misaligned behavior to persist. Financial deterioration accelerates invisibly until crisis forcing drastic action (walk away from business, sacrifice revenue).",
      "downstream_risk": "Financial deterioration accelerates—margins compress, revenue declines. Delivery capacity exhausted serving unprofitable customers—profitable growth impossible. Customer churn from execution failures. Sales force misalignment persists until personnel changes—cultural/incentive issue entrenched. CEO forced to choose between revenue and profitability—walked away from unprofitable renewals sacrificing FY2024 -7% revenue. Competitive position erodes—cannot grow profitably, cannot invest in differentiation. Post-close acquirer inherits margin destruction pattern—unless sales-delivery authority realigned, acquisition value destroyed.",

      "how_failure_is_absorbed": "CEO adjudicates all cross-functional conflicts because no governance layer exists (Stage 4.1: no operating committee, deal review board). BU Presidents lack authority so issues escalate to CEO. CEO absorbs coordination failure through personal intervention: Major deals (healthcare $100M+ TCV), Customer escalations (though many cannot reach CEO per BBB), Strategic decisions, Risk decisions during incidents. CEO serial processing (Stage 4.2) masks parallel coordination requirement—creates illusion organization can coordinate when actually CEO doing all coordination personally. Three CEOs in three years suggests heroics unsustainable—role overloaded.",
      "why_it_is_dangerous": "CEO capacity finite—throughput plateaus at CEO coordination limit regardless of functional capacity additions. CEO becomes bottleneck not leader—consumed by coordination not strategy. Coordination non-scalable—adding organizational volume/complexity overwhelms CEO. Each CEO transition creates coordination collapse—new CEO must rebuild informal coordination patterns. Three CEOs three years indicates pattern unsustainable—suggests CEO heroics failing to mask coordination gaps adequately. Customer complaints 'cannot escalate to senior management' indicates CEO heroics already failing for customer escalations—CEO coordination capacity exceeded.",
      "downstream_risk": "Organizational unscalability—cannot grow beyond CEO coordination capacity. CEO turnover creates coordination crisis—each transition disrupts. Strategic focus impossible—CEO consumed by operational coordination. Decision delays accumulate—CEO queue lengthens, execution stalls. Post-close integration amplifies—additional coordination load overwhelms CEO heroics. Acquirer cannot rely on CEO coordination—structural governance required but doesn't exist. If CEO leaves post-close, coordination collapses completely—no governance infrastructure to sustain coordination.",

Teams absorb risk governance absence through heroics—masking that proactive controls unfunded, incident response process non-existent, vendor dependencies (ScienceLogic) create external constraints.",
      "why_it_is_dangerous": "Incident response heroics non-repeatable—each incident requires re-mobilization. Team burnout from crisis cycles—extended incident response hours unsustainable. Regular work displaced—strategic projects delayed, proactive security investments deferred. Vendor dependencies create external bottlenecks—ScienceLogic zero-day remediation timeline controlled externally, Rackspace dependent. Reactive spending crowds out proactive investment—each incident forces spending that could have prevented incident if allocated proactively (Stage 4.2). Regulatory risk increases—FedRAMP, HIPAA/HITRUST require proactive controls, reactive-only posture creates authorization risk.",
      "downstream_risk": "Incident recurrence inevitable—reactive posture doesn't prevent, only responds. Customer trust erosion—multi-month impacts, 'no apology or solution' per BBB. Regulatory authorization risk—FedRAMP, UK Sovereign, HIPAA/HITRUST require timely incident management. Team attrition from crisis burnout. Monitoring degradation during incidents (Sept 2024 dashboards offline)—creates operational blind spots. Post-close integration amplifies—additional systems/customers increase incident risk, reactive posture cannot scale.

      "how_failure_is_absorbed": "Budget process prioritizes measurable activity metrics: SLA response times (not resolution times), Sales bookings (not delivered profitability), Ticket processing (not customer satisfaction), Headcount (not productivity). Operations absorb underinvestment by optimizing activity metrics while outcome metrics degrade: Support meets SLA response but customers report worsening experience, Sales maintains 400+ reps but revenue declines -7%, Tickets processed but customers complain unresolved. Financial planning masks underinvestment severity by reporting activity metrics that appear stable while business deteriorates.",
      "why_it_is_dangerous": "Management visibility distorted—activity metrics show 'green' while business declining. Resource allocation misguided—invest in maintaining activity metrics (SLA compliance, sales headcount) while starving outcome drivers (resolution quality, delivery profitability, customer satisfaction). Corrective action delayed—problems invisible until financial crisis forces recognition. CEO 'walk away' policy Q4 2024 indicates realization unprofitable despite activity metrics appearing healthy. Sales 'refresh' Q3 2024 indicates recognition sales activity not producing value. Trustpilot 'consistently getting worse' 2024 indicates customer experience declining despite presumably stable support activity metrics.",

Corrective action too late—by time recognized (FY2024 -7% revenue), damage severe. Investment decisions wrong—allocate to activity metrics not outcome drivers. Competitive position erodes invisibly—activity metrics stable while competitors gaining share. Post-close acquirer misled—activity metrics suggest operational health masking outcome degradation. Acquirer must reorient metrics to outcomes—requires operational overhaul, data systems changes. Due diligence misled if relies on activity metrics—true performance much worse than metrics suggest.",
