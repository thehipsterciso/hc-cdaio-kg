BU Presidents accountable for results without authority over sales prioritization, shared services allocation, or technology roadmap.

Sales refresh changed personnel not incentive structure—sales still compensated on bookings volume not delivered profitability (inference from pattern continuation). No deal review board created, delivery still lacks veto authority (Stage 4.1). Walk away policy Q4 2024 requires CEO enforcement—indicates sales won't self-regulate, refresh insufficient.

Activity metrics optimization creates measurement theater—reports green while business deteriorating. Financial planning allocates to activities masking outcome underinvestment.

Operations capable of incident response (demonstrated) but incidents recurring indicates prevention gap—no CRO, no proactive investment, incentive on response speed not frequency reduction. Reactive spending pattern: each incident forces spending exceeding prevention cost but prevention budget unavailable until crisis. Extended incidents indicate burnout risk—24/7 sustained, parallel operational workload, no recovery period.

Sales refresh doesn't stop margin erosion—new personnel inherit same incentive structure and authority gaps.

Invalidations indicate structural reform necessary—personnel optimization, activity metric optimization, heroic workarounds all insufficient without authority reallocation, incentive realignment, governance infrastructure creation."
