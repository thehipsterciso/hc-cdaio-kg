  "summary_rationale": "Stage 4 analysis demonstrates execution reality comprehensively, rigorously, and with appropriate discipline. ALL EIGHT EXIT CRITERIA MET with substantial evidence:\n\n1. Execution bottlenecks (6 identified): CEO serial bottleneck, sales-delivery authority mismatch, multi-jurisdictional 5-6x multiplier—all persistent across personnel changes (three CEOs, sales refresh), quantified impact (margins -13%/-3%, revenue -7%), touch tests documented.\n\n2. Authority mismatches (8 identified): Sales booking authority without delivery veto, BU P&L accountability without cross-functional authority, support satisfaction accountability without resolution authority—creating rational local behavior destructive globally.\n\n3. Escalation failures (8 identified): Customer escalations stall (BBB: 'dozens of engineers', 'cannot reach CEO'), sales escalations too late (post-signature discovery), risk escalation absent (reactive only, no CRO).\n\n4. Dependency failures (7 identified): CEO serial dependency creates systemic paralysis, sales-delivery cascade negative value (margins down, revenue down), multi-jurisdictional 5-6x multiplier permanent penalty.\n\n5. Incentive drag (7 identified): Sales incentive on bookings not profitability, support on SLA not resolution, operations on response not prevention—activity-outcome divergence pervasive, personnel changes don't resolve.\n\n6. Accountability voids (6 identified): Deal profitability split sales/delivery, customer resolution split across functions, proactive risk displaced by reactive—voids persistent structurally.\n\n7. Talent constraints (6 identified): Three CEOs recreate identical bottleneck, sales refresh doesn't stop margin erosion, support heroics mask authority gap—system defeats capability.\n\n8. Heroic fragility (5 identified): Support informal coordination (burnout HIGH), operations sustained crises (burnout HIGH), CEO personal intervention (burnout EXTREME—three transitions prove).\n\nEVIDENCE QUALITY: Claims trace to evidence sources (SEC filings, earnings calls, customer complaints multi-platform, financial data). Cross-file consistency—no contradictions. Touch tests comprehensive—all major items include 'what breaks'. Natural experiments—three CEOs, sales refresh test structural vs individual hypotheses.\n\nHYPOTHESIS DISCIPLINE: All sub-stages test structural vs individual explanations. Disconfirming searches comprehensive and documented. Personnel changes (three CEOs, sales refresh) validate structural hypotheses—patterns persist unchanged. Confirmation bias risk LOW.\n\nUNCERTAINTY PRESERVED: FACT vs INFERENCE distinguished consistently. Unknowns documented explicitly (incentive structure details, attrition rates, burnout severity). UNKNOWN vs UNKNOWABLE classified appropriately. No narrative smoothing—contradictions preserved.\n\nANTI-SOLUTIONING: Outputs pure discovery—no recommendations, no operating model design, no remediation proposals. Could not be misused as 'fix list'—describes execution physics not prescribes solutions. Discovery-only mandate maintained rigorously.\n\nCRITICAL INSIGHT: Execution failures structural not individual. Three CEOs hit identical bottleneck—different individuals, identical system constraint. Sales refresh doesn't stop margin erosion—personnel change, incentive unchanged. Activity metrics stable while outcomes degrade—measurement theater masks deterioration. Heroics mask fragility—temporary workarounds prevent recognition system broken until capacity exhausted. Talent neutralized by structure—capable individuals cannot materially improve execution without structural reform. System defeats competence.\n\nSTAGE 4 SYNTHESIS: Rackspace execution characterized by authority-accountability mismatches creating rational local behavior destructive globally, incentive misalignments driving activity optimization while outcomes degrade, coordination architecture centralizing all cross-functional authority with CEO creating bottleneck, heroics masking structural gaps temporarily while accumulating burnout and fragility. Personnel changes insufficient—structural reform necessary but organization too constrained (CEO bottleneck, capital limitations, change fatigue) to implement. Execution fragility material, compounding, accelerating.\n\nNO REDO REQUIRED. Quality sufficient for Stage 5 progression.",
