    "summary": "Stage 9 analysis successfully identifies and documents enterprise-level fragilities affecting Rackspace's resilience, continuity, and sustainability. All five mandatory exit criteria MET with quality exceeding minimum thresholds. Hypothesis discipline maintained throughout with proper falsification testing (Stage 9.5 rated EXEMPLARY for refuting all three hypotheses when evidence demanded). Uncertainty preservation demonstrates exceptional adherence to Stage 0 Constitutional Controls - 19 uncertainties properly classified, decision impacts quantified with ranges, false confidence risks explicitly warned against. Integration and synthesis files effectively consolidate findings across ESG constraints (9.1), continuity reality (9.2), human capital dependencies (9.3), vendor power dynamics (9.4), and insurance gaps (9.5). Analysis reveals SYSTEMIC FRAGILITY across multiple dimensions rather than isolated issues - resilience is ASSUMED not DEMONSTRATED, with critical dependencies on heroic execution, vendor benevolence, insurance effectiveness, and regulatory forbearance. Quality sufficient to support high-stakes investment decisions with appropriate risk disclosure.",
