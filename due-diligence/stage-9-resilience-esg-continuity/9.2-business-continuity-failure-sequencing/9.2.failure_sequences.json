Rackspace management plane (customer portal, monitoring dashboards, API endpoints if hosted in US-EAST-1) FAILS simultaneously - customers cannot see workload status, cannot submit support tickets through portal, cannot access Rackspace tooling. Rackspace NOC receives flood of customer calls/emails (hundreds to thousands of simultaneous inquiries) overwhelming support queues. NOC engineers determine root cause is AWS infrastructure failure (not Rackspace issue) but CANNOT FIX because Rackspace depends on AWS restoring service.

Rackspace NOC detects anomaly through monitoring alerts (encrypted files, failed vCenter connections, customer tickets) and escalates to security team.

Risk: Incomplete remediation leaves backdoors, attacker returns. Option B: REBUILD ENTIRE ENVIRONMENT from scratch on new hardware - clean slate eliminates persistence risk but requires 4-12 weeks and massive CapEx ($5-20M estimated for replacement hardware across affected facilities). Customers cannot wait 4-12 weeks. Option C: DISCONTINUE SERVICE (December 2022 precedent) - determine repair cost exceeds service value, force customers to migrate elsewhere.

Government customers likely invoke termination for convenience clauses immediately upon notification, creating instant $2-12M annual revenue loss. (2) SEC disclosure: Must assess materiality within days of incident. $20-80M revenue at risk may cross materiality threshold ($50M loss likely material for $2.7B revenue company). If material, 8-K filing required within 4 business days of determination, creating public disclosure pressure.

Strategic question becomes existential: If Rackspace cannot operate securely at scale, can the business survive? Potential outcomes: (1) Private Cloud DISCONTINUED entirely (following Hosted Exchange precedent) - eliminates $1,055M revenue (39% of total) and 40-50% of operating income, making Rackspace unprofitable.
