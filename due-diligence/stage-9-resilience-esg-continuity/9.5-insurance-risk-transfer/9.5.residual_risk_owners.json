SECONDARY: Debt holders bear risk through covenant breach → potential accelerated repayment or control transfer if incidents compress EBITDA below covenant thresholds. TERTIARY: Customers bear risk through service disruption, data loss, and Rackspace's potential inability to compensate beyond contractual minimums (SLA credits insufficient vs actual business damage).",
      "why_it_cannot_be_transferred": "STRUCTURAL LIMITS TO INSURABILITY: (1) Consequential damages LEGALLY EXCLUDED from insurance policies (public policy - cannot insure indirect/speculative losses), (2) Claims history creates UNDERWRITING LIMITS - three incidents in 36 months makes Rackspace 'bad risk', insurers reduce limits or price coverage prohibitively, (3) Valuation impact INHERENTLY UNINSURABLE - Apollo's equity value is speculative future cash flows, no insurance market for this, (4) Revenue loss from customer churn is MARKET BEHAVIOR not insurable event - customers choose to leave, cannot insure against customer choice. MAXIMUM INSURANCE MARKET CAPACITY: Global cyber insurance market provides ~$10-15B annual capacity. Single incident affecting $2.7B revenue company with $200M+ total impact (direct + indirect) exceeds what single insurer or syndicate will cover for any price.

But with CapEx declining 25% and EBITDA margin 3.1% (Stage 5), Rackspace LACKS CAPITAL to fund security improvements, creating FORCED RISK ACCEPTANCE.

CANNOT TRANSFER TO HYPERSCALERS: AWS, Azure, Google contracts DISCLAIM LIABILITY for outages - 'service provided as-is, no warranties, liability limited to service credits' (typically 10-25% monthly fee, trivial vs Rackspace's $8-40M customer SLA exposure). Rackspace is LIABILITY INTERMEDIARY - hyperscaler accepts minimal liability ($X), Rackspace promises substantial liability to customers ($10-100X), Rackspace absorbs gap. CUSTOMERS partially bear risk through: (1) Their own business interruption when workloads down, (2) Rackspace SLA credits (5-25% MRR) insufficient vs customer's actual business losses (customer loses $1M revenue, receives $10K Rackspace credit), (3) Must fund own migration if lose confidence in Rackspace.",

CONTRACTUAL ASYMMETRY: Hyperscalers have SUPERIOR BARGAINING POWER - take-it-or-leave-it contracts with liability caps.

CUSTOMERS bear operational risk: (1) Invoice delays create payment timing uncertainty (customers may hold payment pending invoice), (2) Manual invoice errors (2-5% error rate vs <0.1% automated, Stage 9.2) trigger disputes and relationship friction, (3) Trust erosion from 'can't get billing right' perception.",

Insurance markets do NOT provide liquidity facilities. OPERATIONAL DEPENDENCY NON-TRANSFERABLE: Billing system is SINGLE POINT OF FAILURE for $2.7B revenue realization (Stage 6.3).

Alternative is MANUAL BILLING (labor-intensive, error-prone, slow) which partially mitigates but doesn't eliminate risk.
