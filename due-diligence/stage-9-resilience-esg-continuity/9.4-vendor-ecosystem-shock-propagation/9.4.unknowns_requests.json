Cannot assess future vendor cost risk without seeing: (1) Pricing escalation clauses - are price increases capped (e.g., 'CPI +2%') or unlimited ('vendor may change pricing at any time')?, (2) Minimum commitments - is Rackspace obligated to spend $X annually or pay shortfalls (demand risk)?, (3) Termination provisions - what penalties for early termination (exit feasibility)?, (4) Change control - how much notice for contract changes (can Rackspace prepare or surprised)?, (5) Volume discounts - does pricing improve with scale (margin leverage) or flat regardless of volume?, (6) Term lengths - are contracts 1-year (flexibility) or 3-5 year (locked in)?. Stage 9.2 shows 5% partner credit reduction compresses margin from 10.4% to 5.4% - need to know if contractually protected or vulnerable to repeated reductions. Broadcom $100-210M price shock shows vendor CAN impose unilateral increases - need to verify if contractually permitted or breach (remedies?).",
