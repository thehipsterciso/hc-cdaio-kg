Engineers determine root cause is AWS failure - CANNOT FIX, must wait for AWS restoration.

SLA credit exposure $8-40M estimated (Stage 9.2). Customer business impact compounds - customers' revenue-generating apps DOWN, losses exceed Rackspace SLA credits. Customer churn decisions initiated - 'Why use Rackspace middleman when AWS outage affects us anyway?' TERTIARY (T+30 to T+90 days): Customer churn wave materializes - estimated 5-10% of affected customers ($25-70M annual revenue) terminate via 30-day notice. AWS sales team proactively targets Rackspace customers post-incident offering AWS Managed Services direct. Estimated 10-15% additional churn over 12 months ($50-105M) as AWS capitalizes. AWS partner relationship strain - AWS questions Rackspace value after customer escalations. Potential partner credit reduction from 10-15% to 5-10% = $25-35M annual margin loss (Stage 9.2).

Customer response: 30-50% churn estimated as customers migrate to hyperscaler dedicated hosts or competitors (Stage 6.3). Revenue loss: $316-528M from $1,055M base. FURTHER PRICE INCREASE: If Broadcom increases another 50-100%, makes Private Cloud UNECONOMICAL to operate. Must choose: Accept losses, exit segment (Exchange discontinuation precedent Stage 8.1), or divest to buyer who can absorb costs. LICENSING RESTRICTION: If Broadcom restricts partner reseller terms (precedent: eliminated perpetual licenses, forced subscription), Rackspace may lose ability to provision new VMware infrastructure. Cannot onboard new Private Cloud customers, cannot expand existing. Growth blocked, segment enters managed decline. SUPPORT OUTAGE: If Broadcom support unavailable during critical VMware incident (vCenter failure, ESXi vulnerability), Rackspace engineers cannot escalate to vendor. Extended outages affect customer VMs = SLA breaches, customer churn, reputational damage. TERTIARY: Private Cloud contributes 40-50% of operating income despite 39% of revenue (Stage 5.1).

Margin impact: 5% credit reduction = $25-35M annual gross profit loss. Service restriction: If Rackspace cannot resell high-demand Azure services (AI/ML, new features), competitive disadvantage vs Azure-direct. CAPACITY PRIORITIZATION: During Azure capacity constraints (AI/ML compute shortage, regional capacity limits), Microsoft prioritizes DIRECT enterprise customers over CSP partners.

Customer SLA breaches accumulate from degraded incident response. TERTIARY (Post-incident): CUSTOMER CONFIDENCE DAMAGE - 'Rackspace monitoring failed when we needed it most.' Churn evaluation triggered. OPERATIONS TEAM BURNOUT - responding to incidents blind, managing vendor coordination stress, creates attrition risk (Stage 9.3). DISCONTINUATION SCENARIO: If ScienceLogic discontinues product or exits market (acquisition, bankruptcy), Rackspace must: (1) Find alternative monitoring platform, (2) Migrate thousands of customer monitoring configurations, (3) Retrain operations teams, (4) Timeline: 12-24 months, cost $10-50M estimated.
