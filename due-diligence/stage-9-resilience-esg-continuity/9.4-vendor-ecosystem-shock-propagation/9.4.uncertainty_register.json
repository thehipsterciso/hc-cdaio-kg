      "type": "UNKNOWN",
      "decision_impact": "Cannot model future vendor cost trajectory without understanding contractual price protections. If hyperscaler contracts have: (1) PRICE PROTECTION CLAUSES - 'partner credits cannot decrease more than X% annually' then cost inflation capped, predictable. If NO PROTECTION - vendor can change terms at will, costs unpredictable. If MINIMUM COMMITMENTS - 'must purchase $X annually or pay shortfall' then Rackspace locked into spending regardless of customer demand. Affects: (1) Operating cost modeling - if escalation clauses 5-15% annually, margin compression predictable vs unknown, (2) Segment viability - if minimums exist and demand declines, forced to pay penalties, (3) Exit feasibility - termination penalties may make segment exit economically impossible, (4) Acquisition integration - buyer inherits contracts with unfavorable terms, locked in 2-5 years. MATERIALITY: If vendor contracts have automatic escalation 10-15% annually with 3-5 year lock-in, operating costs increase $100-270M over contract term independent of revenue changes.",
      "what_would_reduce_uncertainty": "Access to: (1) Master services agreements with AWS, Azure, Google showing partner credit terms and change provisions, (2) VMware/Broadcom licensing agreements showing pricing schedule and escalation clauses, (3) ScienceLogic replacement vendor contract (what terms negotiated after being burned?), (4) BT partnership agreement for UK Sovereign showing pricing and termination terms, (5) Vendor relationship governance documents (how often can vendors change terms unilaterally?), (6) Historical vendor contract amendments (have vendors exercised price increase clauses before?).",
      "risk_of_false_confidence": "HIGH. If buyer assumes 'vendor contracts have industry-standard price protections' but reality is take-it-or-leave-it annual renewals, discovers: Vendors CAN and WILL increase prices 10-50% annually (Broadcom precedent), no contractual recourse, must accept or exit business. Stage 9.2 shows partner credit reduction 5% compresses margin from 10.4% to 5.4% - if this can happen REPEATEDLY without contract protection, margin evaporates to zero within 2-3 cycles. If minimums exist ($500M annually with hyperscaler) but Public Cloud declines, Rackspace pays penalty for shortfall creating NEGATIVE MARGIN segment."

      "unknown": "Vendor relationship status and strategic value to vendors - is Rackspace 'strategic partner' receiving preferential treatment or 'standard reseller' expendable in vendor's portfolio?",
      "type": "UNKNOWN",
      "decision_impact": "Vendor treatment differs dramatically based on strategic value. If STRATEGIC PARTNER: (1) Advance notice of program changes (can prepare), (2) Exemptions from adverse changes (protect strategic partners from cost shocks), (3) Dedicated vendor support team (prioritized vs standard partners), (4) Influence on vendor roadmap (can advocate for features needed). If STANDARD RESELLER: (1) No advance notice (surprise changes), (2) No exemptions (all changes apply equally), (3) Standard support channels (low priority), (4) No influence (vendor decisions made without Rackspace input). Stage 6.2 states 'Rackspace has ZERO LEVERAGE' suggesting standard reseller not strategic partner. But confirmation needed. Affects: (1) Vendor shock probability - strategic partners warned/protected, standard resellers surprised, (2) Negotiation feasibility - strategic partners can appeal changes, standard resellers cannot, (3) Program stability - vendors protect strategic relationships, eliminate marginal partners.",
      "what_would_reduce_uncertainty": "Access to: (1) AWS/Azure/Google partnership tier status (Premiere, Advanced, Standard?), (2) Vendor account team assignments (dedicated team vs shared pool suggests status), (3) Vendor QBR (quarterly business review) participation (strategic partners get executive engagement), (4) Early access to vendor program changes (strategic partners informed before public announcement), (5) Vendor-sponsored marketing/co-selling programs (strategic partners receive support), (6) Vendor escalation paths (do Rackspace executives have direct access to vendor executives?).",
      "risk_of_false_confidence": "MEDIUM-HIGH. Stage 6.2 explicitly states 'ZERO LEVERAGE' but Rackspace may internally believe 'we're important partner' due to $1.5B annual spend. If relationship tier is standard reseller: Vendors view Rackspace as commodity partner, can terminate/change terms without concern for relationship damage. Broadcom $100-210M price shock suggests standard reseller treatment (strategic partners would have received advance notice, negotiated exemption). If buyer assumes strategic partnership but inherits standard reseller relationship, cannot execute 'leverage partnership for better terms' integration strategy."

      "unknown": "Actual vendor switching cost beyond Stage 6 inferences - have formal studies, quotes, or migration pilots validated or contradicted estimated $200-500M VMware exit cost?",
      "type": "UNKNOWN",
      "decision_impact": "Stage 6.3 INFERS VMware exit cost $200-500M + churn $316-528M based on customer count, complexity, timeline. But without formal study: (1) Cost may be UNDERSTATED - unforeseen dependencies, integration challenges could double cost to $400M-1B, (2) Cost may be OVERSTATED - some workloads may migrate faster/cheaper than assumed reducing to $100-300M, (3) Churn may differ - customers may embrace migration (virtualization aging, cloud-native opportunity) vs resist. Affects: (1) Broadcom negotiation strategy - if exit truly impossible (cost >$500M), must accept ANY price increase. If exit viable ($200M), can credibly threaten exit for pricing concessions, (2) Acquisition integration planning - buyer may want to consolidate onto buyer's VMware licenses or migrate to alternative - need real costs, (3) Segment divestiture valuation - if exit cost $200M, segment worth less than if exit cost $500M.",
      "what_would_reduce_uncertainty": "Access to: (1) VMware migration feasibility studies commissioned by Rackspace (do any exist?), (2) OpenStack/Nutanix competitive quotes for replacing VMware infrastructure, (3) Customer contract analysis showing migration rights/restrictions, (4) Pilot migration case studies (did Rackspace test migrating subset of customers?), (5) Engineering estimates for re-platforming effort by system/platform, (6) Customer surveys asking 'if we migrated you from VMware to X, would you stay?'.",
      "risk_of_false_confidence": "MEDIUM. Stage 6.3 inference is based on reasonable assumptions (customer count, complexity, market precedent) but lacks precision. If actual cost $200M (low end) vs assumed $500M, changes calculus - exit becomes VIABLE option vs IMPOSSIBLE. Conversely, if actual cost $700M-1B due to unforeseen complexity, Broadcom has EVEN MORE pricing power than assumed. Buyer proceeding without real quotes gambles on Stage 6 inference accuracy. Most likely: Rackspace has NOT commissioned formal study (would show in materials if existed) suggesting inference is BEST AVAILABLE but UNVALIDATED estimate."

Stage 9.2 shows 5% partner credit reduction compresses margin from 10.4% to 5.4% approaching unprofitability. CRITICAL THRESHOLD: If credits reduced ANOTHER 3-5%, segment becomes unprofitable requiring price increases (customer churn) or exit. Cannot predict: (1) WHEN next change occurs - annually? quarterly? ad hoc?, (2) MAGNITUDE of change - 1-2% (manageable) or 10-20% (catastrophic)?, (3) DIRECTION - further reductions (hyperscalers disintermediating) or stability (program mature)?, (4) COORDINATION - do AWS/Azure/Google change programs simultaneously (correlated) or independently (sequential risk)?. Affects: (1) Segment viability timeline - if next reduction 6 months and 5%+, segment unviable 2025, (2) Customer pricing strategy - should pre-emptively raise prices before forced?, (3) Acquisition timing - buyer should close BEFORE next reduction or AFTER (price discovery)?.",
      "what_would_reduce_uncertainty": "CANNOT be fully reduced (vendor decisions unknowable) but indicators help: (1) Hyperscaler financial pressure - if AWS/Azure growth slowing, may reduce partner programs to protect direct sales (leading indicator), (2) Hyperscaler managed services launches - if AWS/Azure expanding native managed services, suggests intent to disintermediate (threat indicator), (3) Partner program history - how frequently have credits changed in past? (establishes pattern), (4) Industry intelligence - are other MSPs seeing program deterioration? (correlated signal), (5) Vendor account team communication - any hints of upcoming changes? (advance warning). Best estimate: Hyperscaler programs DETERIORATING not improving (trend toward direct sales, margin protection) with 12-24 month horizon for next material change.",
      "risk_of_false_confidence": "EXTREME. Hyperscaler partner program changes are UNILATERAL and can be SUDDEN. Buyer assuming 'programs stable for 12-24 months' based on past patterns may face 3-6 month surprise. Precedent: Cloud providers have terminated partner programs with 90-180 days notice forcing rapid adjustments. Stage 9.4 notes 'CORRELATED INCENTIVE TO DISINTERMEDIATE' - all three hyperscalers benefit from eliminating Rackspace middleman. Economic downturn or hyperscaler margin pressure could trigger COORDINATED program reductions affecting AWS+Azure+Google simultaneously. Cannot be predicted with confidence but TREND CLEAR: risk increasing not decreasing over time."

      "type": "UNKNOWABLE",
      "decision_impact": "Broadcom ALREADY extracted $100-210M annually via 200-300% price increase (Stage 6.2). Stage 9.2 warns 'second extraction could be: Further price increase 50-100%, restrictive licensing terms, forced migration to Broadcom cloud platform'. CRITICAL for Private Cloud segment ($1,055M, 39% revenue, 40-50% operating income): (1) If 50% additional increase = $150-315M annually, Private Cloud becomes UNPROFITABLE (current gross margin 40-50% = $422-528M, minus vendor increase = $107-378M remaining insufficient for operating costs), (2) If licensing restrictions prevent new infrastructure provisioning, growth halted + existing customer churn when cannot expand, (3) If forced to Broadcom cloud = BUSINESS MODEL DESTRUCTION (customers didn't choose Broadcom cloud, chose Rackspace-managed VMware). Cannot predict WHEN (Broadcom timeline unknowable) or MAGNITUDE (depends on Broadcom strategy, market acceptance of first increase). Affects: (1) Segment viability timeline, (2) Customer pricing strategy (when to pass through next increase?), (3) Segment divestiture timing (should divest BEFORE second extraction?).",
      "what_would_reduce_uncertainty": "CANNOT be fully reduced (Broadcom decisions unknowable and UNILATERAL) but monitoring helps: (1) Broadcom public statements on VMware pricing strategy (any signals of 'pricing complete' vs 'ongoing optimization'?), (2) Broadcom customer/partner communications (are others receiving price increase notices?), (3) Industry analyst reports on Broadcom VMware strategy (M&A strategy suggests extract then divest?), (4) Competitive intelligence on other VMware MSPs (are they experiencing second price shock?), (5) Legal/regulatory developments (any anti-trust scrutiny constraining Broadcom pricing power?). Best estimate: Second extraction LIKELY within 12-24 months (Broadcom acquisition 2023, first extraction immediate, second extraction normal cadence for value extraction strategy).",
      "risk_of_false_confidence": "EXTREME. First extraction ($100-210M) was SURPRISE to market - Rackspace did not anticipate magnitude or timing. Second extraction carries SAME unpredictability. Buyer assuming 'Broadcom got their increase, now stable' may face second shock 6-12 months post-close destroying acquisition economics. Stage 6.3 'VENDOR HOSTAGE' assessment proves Broadcom KNOWS Rackspace cannot leave and will CONTINUE extracting until segment unprofitable or Rackspace exits. Precedent: Broadcom known for multi-year value extraction post-acquisition, not one-time repricing. Private Cloud 40-50% of operating income - second extraction could eliminate MAJORITY of company profitability."
