This requires $263M NEW bookings just to maintain revenue in these segments, before any growth or offsetting churn in other segments. Stage 2.1 shows total bookings growth 14% on $2,737M = $383M new bookings, but revenue declined 7% ($192M loss), implying TOTAL CHURN across all segments ~$575M ($383M new - $192M net decline).

IMPLICATION: As low-lock-in revenue churns away, revenue declines but profit INITIALLY STABLE (mix shift toward high-margin customers). However, this is DEATH SPIRAL: (1) SG&A $709M is FIXED (Stage 2.2), so declining revenue increases SG&A % (leverage works in reverse), (2) High-lock-in segment revenue also declining (Private Cloud -13% YoY per Stage 2.1), (3) Eventually high-margin revenue insufficient to cover fixed costs.

CRITICAL VULNERABILITY: These non-contractual barriers are ERODIBLE: (1) Competitors can offer free migration services (AWS/Azure have migration teams), eliminating economic barrier, (2) Technology commoditization reduces technical barriers (Kubernetes portability eliminates VMware lock-in), (3) Customer IT teams building migration expertise reduces operational barriers (more comfortable switching), (4) Government procurement streamlining (GSA schedules, pre-approved vendor lists) reduces procurement barriers. IMPLICATION: Rackspace retention advantage is FRAGILE and DECLINING over time as market evolves to reduce switching costs. Without building CONTRACTUAL lock-in (which may alienate customers) or DIFFERENTIATION lock-in (proprietary technology creating vendor dependence, which conflicts with multi-cloud strategy), retention will continue eroding. Month-to-month billing was likely CUSTOMER ACQUISITION strategy (remove barriers to trying Rackspace) but creates RETENTION VULNERABILITY long-term."
