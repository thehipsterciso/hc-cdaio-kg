IMPLICATION: Rackspace retention is DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL to switching cost barriers, NOT service quality or value delivery. Where customers CAN leave easily (SMB, Mid-Market), they DO leave at high rates. Where customers CANNOT leave easily (Large Enterprise, Government), they stay despite service issues. This suggests RETENTION IS STRUCTURAL, not earned through superior service."

Retention depends ENTIRELY on: (1) Technical/operational switching costs (high for Private Cloud, low for Public Cloud, zero for email), (2) Procurement friction (high for government, zero for SMB), (3) Economic switching costs (high for large enterprise, trivial for SMB). IMPLICATION: Rackspace has NO CONTRACTUAL BARRIERS preventing customer exit. Any retention advantage is from OPERATIONAL FRICTION not contractual protection.

This is RATIONAL from unit economics (relationship investment only justified by customer lifetime value), but creates BIFURCATED RETENTION STRATEGY: (1) Large Enterprise and Government: retention through relationship + switching costs, (2) Mid-Market: retention through switching costs only (no relationship investment), (3) SMB: no retention strategy (accepting high churn as cost of low-value customers)."

Hyperscalers have DIRECT RELATIONSHIP with underlying infrastructure, giving them VISIBILITY into customer workloads and opportunity to solicit direct business. Rackspace is DISINTERMEDIATED - customer relationship is through management services, not infrastructure ownership. IMPLICATION: Public Cloud (30-40% of revenue per customer_segments.json) has STRUCTURAL CHURN VULNERABILITY that cannot be eliminated without changing business model (owning infrastructure vs reselling hyperscaler capacity).
