No automated validation - relies on peer review (if performed) or customer testing (expensive).

Cannot substitute alternative without customer consent and re-architecture. FACILITIES DEPENDENCY: Deployment requires available data center capacity (space, power, cooling). If data center at capacity, must deploy in different location (potentially non-optimal for customer latency) or delay sale until capacity available.

FedRAMP is GATEKEEPER - agencies CANNOT use non-FedRAMP providers regardless of technical superiority or cost savings.

MISALIGNMENT CREATES FRICTION: If sales sells capabilities delivery cannot support, customer dissatisfaction begins at handoff. If handoff documentation poor (requirements unclear, design incomplete, SLAs ambiguous), delivery team must RE-DISCOVER customer needs causing delays and errors. Value perception PEAKS at contract signing (customer excited, hopeful), then often DECLINES during handoff period (reality sets in, delays occur, complexity discovered).

RISK: Customer dissatisfaction at earliest stage (most vulnerable to churn), Scope creep (ambiguous sales commitments interpreted broadly by customer, narrowly by delivery = conflict), SLA disputes (sales may promise aggressive SLAs delivery cannot meet without overstaffing), Expectation mismatch leading to escalations, executive involvement, relationship damage.

No shared metrics bridging sales/delivery creates principal-agent problem.

DEPENDENCY ON CUSTOMER AVAILABILITY: Handoff requires customer participation (requirements validation, access provisioning, migration scheduling). If customer unresponsive or under-resourced, handoff delays revenue realization.
