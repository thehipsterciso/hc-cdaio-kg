    "Evidence of LOW customer churn rates (<10% annually) indicating strong retention (SOUGHT but NOT FOUND): Revenue declining 7% YoY despite bookings growth 14% suggests HIGH churn (~21% implied).",
    "Evidence of HIGH customer satisfaction, NPS scores, or retention metrics supporting 'Fanatical Support' value proposition (SOUGHT but NOT FOUND): No recent customer satisfaction data disclosed.",
    "Evidence of entity consolidation or structural simplification reducing multi-entity fragmentation (SOUGHT but NOT FOUND): Stage 1 indicates fragmentation is mandatory and permanent.",
    "Evidence of FAST Private Cloud deployment cycles (<4 weeks) competitive with public cloud (SOUGHT but NOT FOUND): 8-20 week typical cycle inferred from procurement/deployment/migration requirements.",
    "Evidence of EFFICIENT sales-to-delivery handoff (e.g., <5 days, low rework rate, high customer satisfaction) (SOUGHT but NOT FOUND): Industry knowledge suggests handoffs are friction points.",
    "Evidence of SHARED SERVICES or coordination mechanisms reducing cross-entity operational friction (SOUGHT but NOT FOUND): Government/UK Sovereign isolation prevents sharing.",
    "Evidence of PRE-PROVISIONED Private Cloud capacity reducing customer lead times (SOUGHT but NOT FOUND): CapEx model requires customer-specific procurement.",
    "Evidence of CUSTOMER LOYALTY programs, retention initiatives, or switching cost mechanisms reducing churn (SOUGHT but NOT FOUND): Month-to-month billing indicates zero lock-in.",
    "Evidence of WORKING CAPITAL efficiency in Private Cloud (e.g., customer deposits, milestone billing) reducing in-flight CapEx (SOUGHT but NOT FOUND): Standard industry practice is CapEx before revenue.",
    "Evidence of AUTOMATED HANDOFF processes, CRM/ticketing system integration, or knowledge management reducing manual coordination (SOUGHT but NOT FOUND): Acquired entity integration uncertain per Stage 1.",
    "Evidence of VALUE FLOW optimization initiatives or process improvements reducing friction (SOUGHT but NOT FOUND): No operational improvement programs disclosed.",
    "Evidence of CHURN REDUCTION programs showing measurable success (SOUGHT but NOT FOUND): Revenue continuing to decline.",
    "Evidence of CUSTOMER ONBOARDING excellence creating strong first impressions and reducing Year 1 churn (SOUGHT but NOT FOUND): No onboarding metrics disclosed.",
    "Evidence of MULTI-CLOUD COMPLEXITY being managed effectively (skills, tools, coordination across AWS/Azure/Google) (SOUGHT but NOT FOUND): Public Cloud declining 3% suggests competitive pressure.",
    "Evidence of MIGRATION SUCCESS rates exceeding industry benchmarks (>80% success, <20% rework) (SOUGHT but NOT FOUND): Stage 1 cited 20-30% typical migration failure rate.",
    "Evidence of CUSTOMER LIFETIME VALUE metrics showing profitable customer economics (LTV/CAC >3:1) (SOUGHT but NOT FOUND): Implied 21% churn suggests short lifetimes and poor unit economics.",
    "Evidence of JURISDICTIONAL COORDINATION reducing operational silos (e.g., matrix management, shared KPIs) (SOUGHT but NOT FOUND): Fragmentation appears permanent.",
    "Evidence of VENDOR RELATIONSHIP improvements reducing Private Cloud procurement lead times (SOUGHT but NOT FOUND): Hardware lead times industry-standard.",
    "Evidence of SUPPLY CHAIN optimization or inventory pre-positioning reducing Private Cloud cycle time (SOUGHT but NOT FOUND): CapEx declining 25% suggests underinvestment, not optimization.",
    "Evidence of CUSTOMER SEGMENTS with low churn or high satisfaction (e.g., Government retention >90%) (SOUGHT but NOT FOUND): Segment-specific retention not disclosed."
