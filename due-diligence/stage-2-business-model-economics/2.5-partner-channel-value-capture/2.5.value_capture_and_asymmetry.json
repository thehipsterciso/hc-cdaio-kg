(2) LOCK-IN ADVANTAGE: Rackspace cannot migrate customers off VMware without 20-30% migration failure rate and multi-year timeline, forcing Rackspace to absorb price increases or pass through (churn risk either way). (3) STRATEGIC OPTIONALITY: VMware has thousands of enterprise customers - Rackspace is <1% of VMware revenue (estimated).
