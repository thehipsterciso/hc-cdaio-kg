Economic barrier is VERY HIGH - customer must expect $10M+ cost savings or major service improvement over 3-5 years to justify $2-10M switching investment (3-5 year payback threshold).

SECONDARY SOURCE: Operational dependencies (agency personnel trained on Rackspace, integration with agency systems), but PROCUREMENT FRICTION is dominant inertia mechanism - technical switching is manageable (3-9 months per Stage 2.4), but procurement timeline (6-12 months) and approval bureaucracy create structural delay making switching slow and painful even when desired.",

Economic cost is MODERATE but POLITICAL COST is HIGH - procurement and migration require extensive justification to agency leadership, switching without clear performance failure or cost savings risks career damage for IT leadership ('why are you disrupting working systems?'), creates personal disincentive to switch even if objectively warranted. TIME COST is EXTREME - 12-27 months total per Stage 2.4 (procurement 6-12 months + technical 3-9 months + operational 3-6 months) means switching takes 1-2+ years, during which incumbent can address issues or reduce prices to retain customer.",

CRITICAL DISTINCTION: Inertia is BEHAVIORAL not STRUCTURAL - Stage 2.4 documents LOW technical/economic/contractual lock-in ($50K-500K costs, 3-6 months, 30-day termination notice), customers CAN switch easily but DON'T because evaluation requires effort and perceived benefit is low.

ECONOMIC BARRIER IS LOW - mid-market customers can justify switching with 6-12 months cost savings or service improvement (vs 3-5 years for Large Enterprise), making price-based competition effective. Stage 2.4 estimated 15-25% annual churn PROVES economic barrier is insufficient to prevent switching - customers DO switch frequently when incentivized (hyperscaler incentives, competitive pricing, service issues).
