    "Constraint-based retention (switching costs, inertia) not loyalty-based retention - Email segment definitively proves pattern, appears stable until triggered then collapses non-linearly",
    "Power asymmetry extreme: hyperscalers 89.6% value capture vs Rackspace 10.4%, 20-30X profit per customer spend, <0.5% revenue materiality = zero negotiating leverage",
    "Pricing power ZERO across all segments regardless of switching costs - Email 706% catastrophic failure in low-lock-in, Private Cloud -13% despite high-lock-in, bookings -21% company-wide",
    "VMware shock transfers $100-210M annually to vendor, creates $90-150M latent customer churn, Private Cloud economics terminally damaged",
    "Margin compression structural and irreversible - partner credits declining (30-65% margin compression), commoditization (15-25% to 5-15% margins), scale impossibility (25.9% SG&A vs 15-18% efficient)",
    "Private Cloud facing triple threat: VMware pricing destruction + cloud-native architectural obsolescence + segment contributes 40-50% operating income creating existential dependency on declining asset",
    "AI automation represents extinction-level threat to MSP business model - eliminates 70-80% of value proposition, enables customer insourcing at 80-90% cost savings, business model obsolescence irreversible",
    "Thin margins (3.1% EBITDA) create zero shock absorption - 10% revenue shock eliminates profitability, any external shock triggers financial distress, covenant breach, restructuring within 6-18 months",
    "Recovery from shocks structurally impossible - customer migrations permanent (switching costs work both directions), capability gaps compound exponentially, adverse selection degrades portfolio permanently"
