Example: H1 (hyperscalers price setters) searched for MSP-hyperscaler long-term agreements with credit guarantees - NONE found. H3 (pricing power only in high-lock-in segments) searched for successful price increases in low-lock-in segments - Email increase COUNTER-EVIDENCE proving hypothesis. Status determinations well-supported: all 5 marked SUPPORTED or STRONGLY SUPPORTED with comprehensive evidence. No confirmation bias detected - actively sought and acknowledged disconfirming evidence."

Explicitly searched for disconfirming evidence: H1 (hyperscaler-direct primary threat) searched for hyperscaler channel commitment and direct managed services failures - found OPPOSITE evidence (services expanding not failing). H3 (response constraints structural) searched for successful competitive responses through operational improvements - found improvements INSUFFICIENT (headcount cuts failed to prevent decline). All hypotheses marked SUPPORTED with detailed evidence citations. Disconfirming evidence search documented separately showing systematic attempts to invalidate hypotheses."

H1 (retention is constraint not loyalty) explicitly searched for service quality predicting retention - found OPPOSITE (Email adequate service but zero loyalty). H2 (loyalty signals misleading) searched for renewal rates accurately predicting future retention - found renewals persisted for YEARS before Email collapse proving FALSE SIGNAL. H4 (switching costs create delay not prevention) searched for permanent retention from switching costs - found Private Cloud declining 13% proves costs don't prevent eventual churn. Email segment used as DEFINITIVE PROOF CASE across multiple hypotheses. All marked STRONGLY SUPPORTED with comprehensive evidence. Outstanding disconfirmation discipline."

      "notes": "STRONG hypothesis discipline despite limited hypothesis framework visibility in primary artifacts (pricing behaviors document contains analysis but not explicit hypothesis structure). Disconfirming evidence search documented separately showing systematic attempts. Analysis treats Email 706% as DEFINITIVE TEST CASE of pricing power - attempted price increase, catastrophic failure provides unambiguous disconfirmation of pricing power beliefs. VMware cost pass-through analysis treats partial transmission as PROOF of zero pricing power (cannot absorb, cannot fully pass through, trapped). No evidence of confirmation bias - consistently interprets evidence as showing pricing power absence not presence."

Explicitly searched for disconfirming evidence: H1 (hyperscalers hold pricing power) searched for MSP negotiating success - NOT FOUND. H2 (dependency creates vulnerability) searched for diversification success - found concentration INCREASING not decreasing. H5 (marketplace dependency irreversible) searched for customer preference for direct billing - found marketplace adoption ACCELERATING. All hypotheses marked SUPPORTED with evidence. Uncertainty register comprehensive (4 major unknowns documented). Good falsification discipline."

      "notes": "STRONG hypothesis discipline in shock analysis context. 5 hypotheses testing shock transmission, recovery feasibility, and retention fragility under stress. H1 (Rackspace transmits shocks) searched for shock absorption evidence - found EMAIL and VMware as transmission examples. H3 (recovery structurally limited) searched for customers returning after stress - NOT FOUND, historical precedent shows permanent shifts. H4 (constraint-based retention fragile) uses Email as PROOF - inertia appeared stable for years then broke instantly. Disconfirming evidence search documented (10 searches including recession performance, AI automation demand increase, geopolitical decoupling reversal - all NOT FOUND or CONTRADICTED). Excellent use of historical precedent and structural analysis to test shock permanence."
