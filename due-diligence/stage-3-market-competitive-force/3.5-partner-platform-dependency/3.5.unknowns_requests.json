Stage 3.4 estimates partner credits declined from 20-25% historically to 10-15% currently, causing 30-65% gross margin compression, but based on industry patterns not Rackspace-specific data. Actual credits determine whether Public Cloud segment is: (A) VIABLE with mid-single-digit margins (15-20% credits = ~5-8% gross margin possible after other costs), (B) BARELY VIABLE with low single-digit margins (10-15% credits = ~2-4% gross margin squeezed), or (C) UNVIABLE with zero/negative margins (5-10% credits = ~0-2% gross margin insufficient to cover sales/support/overhead). Also determines vulnerability to further deterioration: if currently 15% with stable program, can model gradual decline to 12-13% over 3-5 years (manageable slow erosion), if currently 10% with aggressive program changes, could decline to 5-7% rapidly (crisis within 2-3 years requiring immediate restructuring/exit). Material to M&A valuation: Public Cloud ~$690M revenue (50% of company), if segment is unviable or approaching unviable, company loses half its revenue base over 3-5 years, fundamentally different investment case (harvest declining asset vs turnaround with viable core).",

(2) Historical partner program statements 2020-2024: quarterly or annual statements showing credits earned, effective discount percentages, program tier achieved. This reveals trend line (credits declining 5% annually? 10% annually? accelerating or stabilizing?). (3) Partner program communications from hyperscalers: program changes announced 2022-2024, requirements tightening, tier restructuring, new obligations introduced. Shows whether erosion is systematic strategy (continued pressure) or stabilizing (reached new equilibrium). (4) Hyperscaler invoices and payment terms: sample invoices showing gross list price, discounts applied, net payment, payment terms (immediate vs 30/60/90 day = working capital impact). This is HIGHLY SENSITIVE commercial data (hyperscalers require confidentiality) but ESSENTIAL for accurate Public Cloud economics assessment.

BUILD THREE SCENARIOS: PESSIMISTIC (5-10% current credits, declining to 3-7% by 2027 = Public Cloud unprofitable within 3 years, segment exit required), BASE (10-15% current, declining to 7-12% by 2027 = barely viable low single-digit margins, harvest mode), OPTIMISTIC (15-20% current, stable at 12-17% through 2027 = mid single-digit margins, viable if declining). Weight scenarios: 20% optimistic (unlikely given competitive dynamics), 50% base (most consistent with observed 3.1% company margins and Public Cloud estimated 3-5% segment margins), 30% pessimistic (possible if Rackspace receiving worse terms than typical MSPs due to hyperscaler competitive conflict). Use BASE scenario for primary valuation, show PESSIMISTIC scenario for downside risk quantification."

If Rackspace has contractual price protection through 2026-2027, buys time for managed migration to alternative platforms (OpenStack, KVM, cloud-native). If NO protection, Broadcom can impose further increases immediately, forces URGENT RESTRUCTURING (accept deep losses, rapid customer migration attempt, or segment exit within 12-24 months). Affects M&A timing and structure: Protected through 2026 = can execute 18-24 month structured sale process (maximize value, orderly transition), No protection = must transact within 6-12 months (distressed sale, accept lower valuation) or face Private Cloud collapse during M&A process (destroys 35% of company revenue mid-transaction = deal risk).",

MODEL SCENARIOS: BASE CASE (current $100-210M annual cost persists through 2025-2027, no further increases but no relief), STRESS CASE (Broadcom increases additional 50-100% by 2026 = $150-315M total annual cost, 50-105% of Private Cloud revenue consumed by VMware licensing alone, segment deeply unprofitable requiring immediate restructuring). Given Broadcom's track record (typically increases prices 200-300% on acquired software assets), STRESS CASE has 40-50% probability (not tail risk, materially likely outcome). Use BASE CASE for primary analysis but EMPHASIZE STRESS CASE RISK in diligence outputs (VMware further increases could destroy remaining Private Cloud segment viability, management must have contingency plans for 50-100% additional increase scenario)."

Model as BASE CASE given strong industry evidence and logical customer behavior (marketplace simplifies procurement, enterprises standardizing on hyperscaler billing).

If compliance is $8-10M annually (high end estimate) on $127M segment = 6-8% of revenue, with estimated gross margins 15-20% leaves 7-12% to cover sales/support/G&A = barely sufficient for 0-3% EBITDA, segment is STRUCTURALLY CONSTRAINED (cannot improve materially without reducing compliance burden, but burden is mandatory).

(3) Compliance cost allocation: which segments bear which costs (FedRAMP allocated to Government segment only or company-wide? SOC 2 company-wide or segment-specific?), affects segment-level margin calculations. (4) Certification ROI analysis: what revenue does each certification enable (FedRAMP enables federal sales $70-90M estimate, UK Sovereign enables UK government $30-50M), helps assess whether investments justified by returns.

(2) UK Sovereign: Initial $5-15M (Stage 2.5 documented), annual maintenance $500K-1M estimated (similar to FedRAMP).
