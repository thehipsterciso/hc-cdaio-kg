DISCONFIRMING EVIDENCE NOT FOUND: Searched for hyperscaler channel commitment - found OPPOSITE evidence (direct managed services expansion indicates disintermediation strategy not channel commitment). Searched for hyperscaler direct managed services failures - found services are growing not failing. Searched for high management-switching friction - found LOW friction per Stage 2.4. CONCLUSION: Hypothesis STRONGLY SUPPORTED. Hyperscaler-direct is primary threat through disintermediation mechanism requiring minimal customer disruption."
