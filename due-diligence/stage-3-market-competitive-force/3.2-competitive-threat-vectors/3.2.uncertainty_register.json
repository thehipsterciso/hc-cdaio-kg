      "type": "UNKNOWN",
      "decision_impact": "CRITICAL - Determines timeline to Public Cloud business failure. If 5-10% annually (slow erosion), Rackspace has 5-7 year runway to exit/transform. If 15-25% annually (rapid erosion), Rackspace has 2-3 year runway before segment unviable. If 30%+ annually (death spiral), segment failure within 18-24 months. Difference is material to M&A urgency, valuation, and strategic option viability. Without knowing actual customer loss rate to hyperscaler-direct vs other factors (low-cost MSPs, insourcing, hyperscaler credit pressure), cannot precisely forecast Public Cloud trajectory and business viability timeline.",
      "what_would_reduce_uncertainty": "MANAGEMENT ACCESS REQUIRED. Need: (1) Customer churn analysis by destination (hyperscaler-direct vs low-cost MSP vs insourcing vs other), (2) Win/loss analysis from competitive sales situations showing hyperscaler-direct as competitor frequency, (3) Customer interviews about future intentions (evaluating hyperscaler-direct migration?), (4) Sales pipeline analysis showing hyperscaler-direct threat frequency in renewal discussions. Without management data showing churn destinations, can only infer from aggregate 21% net leakage (Stage 2.1) without attribution. Industry channel checks with other MSPs about hyperscaler-direct pressure would provide comparative data but Rackspace-specific rate remains UNKNOWN."

      "unknown": "Hyperscaler sales force incentive structures and targeting strategies - are hyperscaler account teams actively incentivized and trained to convert MSP-managed customers to direct, or is disintermediation organic customer-driven?",
      "type": "UNKNOWN",
      "decision_impact": "MATERIAL - Determines whether hyperscaler-direct threat is ACTIVE (hyperscalers hunting MSP customers aggressively) vs PASSIVE (customers discovering hyperscaler-direct organically). If ACTIVE with sales incentives and targeting, threat accelerates rapidly (sales teams closing 20-30% of targeted accounts annually). If PASSIVE, threat grows slower (customers discover over 3-5 years). Difference affects threat urgency and defensive response strategy (if active hunting, must respond immediately with retention programs; if passive discovery, can delay response). Industry sources suggest hyperscaler sales teams ARE incentivized to convert partner customers (anecdotal), but actual incentive structures and targeting playbooks are confidential commercial strategy.",
      "what_would_reduce_uncertainty": "PARTIALLY KNOWABLE through: (1) Customer interviews asking if AWS/Azure/Google account teams have proactively pitched direct managed services (indicates active targeting), (2) Hyperscaler partner sales interactions - do hyperscaler reps discuss keeping customers away from direct services or is topic avoided? (3) Industry channel checks with MSPs about hyperscaler competitive behavior (consistent patterns indicate systematic strategy), (4) Analysis of hyperscaler direct managed services growth rates (rapid growth suggests active sales effort not passive discovery), (5) LinkedIn analysis of hyperscaler sales job postings/descriptions mentioning 'partner customer migration' or similar. Combination of customer feedback, peer insights, and growth data would provide directional answer but precise incentive structures likely unknowable externally."

      "unknown": "Low-cost MSP competitive positioning and win rates against Rackspace - are offshore providers actually winning significant business from Rackspace or is threat theoretical?",
      "type": "UNKNOWN",
      "decision_impact": "MODERATE - Determines whether low-cost threat is IMMINENT (already losing deals) vs EMERGING (threat building but not yet material). If low-cost providers winning 10-20% of competitive situations (material threat), Rackspace must respond with pricing or positioning changes immediately. If low-cost providers winning <5% of situations (marginal threat), can deprioritize response. However, Stage 3.2 analysis already established structural cost disadvantage (50-70% labor cost gap, 25.9% vs 15% SG&A) making low-cost competition inevitable even if not yet material. Timing uncertainty (is threat materializing in 2025-2026 or 2028-2030?) affects response urgency but does not change strategic assessment of structural vulnerability.",
      "what_would_reduce_uncertainty": "MANAGEMENT ACCESS PREFERRED. Need: (1) Win/loss analysis showing low-cost MSP competitor frequency in lost deals, (2) Customer feedback on evaluation criteria (is price primary driver indicating commoditization?), (3) Sales team intelligence on competitive landscape shifts, (4) RFP response analysis showing pricing gaps vs offshore competitors. ALTERNATIVE: Industry research through (1) Customer interviews about offshore MSP consideration, (2) Consulting firm reports on MSP market share trends, (3) Offshore IT services firm (Wipro, Infosys, TCS) public disclosures about cloud services growth in US market. Combination would indicate if low-cost threat is current or future but Rackspace-specific win/loss data remains most valuable."

      "type": "UNKNOWN",
      "decision_impact": "MODERATE-HIGH - Determines viability of managed services business model long-term. If 10-20% of large enterprise customers insourcing over 5 years (material erosion), MSP model has finite lifespan similar to managed hosting in 2000s. If <5% insourcing (niche behavior), MSP model remains viable for most customers. Affects strategic assessment of whether Rackspace is in DECLINING CATEGORY (build-vs-buy shifting to build) vs PRESSURED BUSINESS (margin compression but model persists). Uncertainty matters more for 5-10 year valuation horizon (is MSP model obsolescent?) than 2-3 year (immediate threats from hyperscaler-direct and cost competition dominate regardless of insourcing rate).",
      "what_would_reduce_uncertainty": "RESEARCH REDUCIBLE. Can investigate through: (1) Enterprise IT hiring trends - cloud engineer job posting growth rates at Fortune 1000 companies indicates insourcing acceleration, (2) Customer interviews about cloud operating model evolution (insourcing plans, internal team building), (3) MSP industry surveys showing customer churn by reason (insourcing vs switching providers), (4) Cloud platform certification trends - if enterprises buying AWS/Azure/Google training for internal staff at scale, indicates insourcing strategy, (5) FinOps and cloud management tool adoption rates - enterprises buying tooling for internal teams vs relying on MSP. Combination of hiring data, customer research, and tooling adoption would quantify insourcing trend. Stage 3.1 identified tooling democratization and talent availability enabling insourcing, but RATE remains uncertain."

      "type": "UNKNOWN",
      "decision_impact": "MODERATE - Determines whether bundling threat is MATERIAL (losing 10-20% of opportunities to bundled offerings) vs THEORETICAL (discussed but rarely chosen). If material, indicates Rackspace excluded from enterprise purchasing decisions at strategic level (EA negotiations, vendor consolidation initiatives). If theoretical, competitive positioning remains at tactical level (service quality, pricing). However, Stage 3.2 already established Rackspace lacks bundling assets and cannot respond regardless of threat magnitude, so uncertainty affects assessment of current damage but not strategic vulnerability. Bundling threat is STRUCTURAL regardless of current materiality.",
      "what_would_reduce_uncertainty": "MANAGEMENT ACCESS REQUIRED. Need: (1) Win/loss analysis showing integrated vendor competitors (IBM, Oracle, Dell, Accenture) and bundled offering frequency, (2) Customer feedback on vendor consolidation and EA inclusion requirements, (3) Sales team intelligence on exclusion from enterprise strategic vendor lists, (4) Analysis of lost opportunities due to EA restrictions (customer cannot add non-EA vendor). Without management data, can only infer that bundling is competitive disadvantage from Rackspace standalone position, but actual business impact quantification requires win/loss data. Industry research on enterprise EA trends would provide context but not Rackspace-specific impact."

      "decision_impact": "CRITICAL for UK Sovereign segment viability. If AWS UK Sovereign launches in 2025 with full service availability (estimated), Rackspace's UK Sovereign early-mover advantage collapses within 12-18 months (customers in pipeline evaluate AWS alternative, existing customers consider migration). If AWS launch delayed to 2026-2027 (implementation complexity, regulatory approvals), Rackspace has 2-3 year window to establish customer base and operational scale before major competition arrives. Difference is $100-200M revenue at stake (UK Sovereign growth potential) and $5-15M sunk investment risk. Timing uncertainty affects UK Sovereign business case and Rackspace's only growth narrative viability.",
      "what_would_reduce_uncertainty": "PARTIALLY KNOWABLE through: (1) AWS public announcements and partner communications about UK Sovereign Cloud roadmap (may provide launch timeline guidance), (2) UK government and NHS procurement discussions/RFPs mentioning AWS UK Sovereign as option (indicates expected availability), (3) Industry analyst reports tracking AWS UK Sovereign development, (4) AWS hiring patterns in UK (cloud operations roles in UK data centers indicates launch preparation). MANAGEMENT ACCESS: Rackspace UK Sovereign sales team likely has competitive intelligence from customer conversations ('waiting for AWS UK Sovereign before deciding'). Combination of public signals and customer feedback would narrow timeline uncertainty from 1-3 years to 6-12 months."
