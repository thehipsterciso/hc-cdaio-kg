Under stress (major incident), discover: Must self-fund $20-100M immediately despite insurance, covenant breach risk before reimbursement arrives (6-18 months), emergency Apollo injection required. Contradiction between assumed protection and actual reality creates HIDDEN FRAGILITY - capital planning and risk tolerance based on false premise.

But Stage 6.2 confirms: 'Multi-cloud is FICTION - customers choose specific cloud, workloads not portable.' Customer applications use proprietary services (Lambda, RDS, Azure Functions) that are hyperscaler-locked. Under stress (hyperscaler outage), customers discover: NO failover capability exists, Rackspace cannot move workloads to alternative cloud during outage, must wait for primary hyperscaler recovery (6-12+ hours). Customer expectation vs reality gap triggers: 'Why am I paying Rackspace premium when there's no actual redundancy?' → 15-25% churn per Stage 9.2. FALSE RESILIENCE CLAIM prevents building ACTUAL redundancy (expensive but would work) because leadership believes 'we already have multi-cloud' (marketing not architecture).",

Under stress (vendor program changes, capacity allocation, support prioritization), discover: Vendors prioritize DIRECT enterprise customers over partners, Rackspace cannot compel faster resolution or preferential treatment, partner program terms changed UNILATERALLY without negotiation (Broadcom 200-300% price shock precedent). Cannot threaten to leave (100% dependent, no alternatives), vendors CAN threaten terms changes (Rackspace must accept).

Authority architecture CENTRALIZES all cross-BU decisions, major deals, customer escalations with CEO.

Under stress (fourth CEO transition), discover: Cannot fix by hiring (proven by three attempts), organizational coordination DEPENDENT on individual not system (non-scalable), each transition creates cumulative knowledge loss and coordination collapse.
