H1 example: Hypothesis that 'stated continuity plans overstate recovery capability' tested by searching for: (1) Evidence of RTO/RPO achievement during incidents (NONE FOUND - Exchange resulted in discontinuation), (2) Multi-cloud failover capability (FICTION per Stage 6.2), (3) Platform redundancy (SINGLE POINTS OF FAILURE per Stage 6.3), (4) Hyperscaler leverage (ZERO per Stage 6.2). All disconfirming searches executed, hypothesis SUPPORTED by failure to find counter-evidence. Proper falsification discipline applied. PASS."

Example: 'Heroic execution is sustainable' tested by searching for evidence of: workload distribution improvements, burnout mitigation programs, talent retention success.

All three hypotheses (H1: liquidity protection, H2: renewal stability, H3: comprehensive risk transfer) REFUTED through systematic disconfirmation testing. Each hypothesis tested across 4 dimensions with specific disconfirming evidence sought. Example H1 tests: Exchange recovery adequacy (FAILED - 50% only), BI coverage triggers (FAILED - physical damage required), claims timing (FAILED - 6-18 months vs immediate need), aggregate limits (FAILED - depleted by multiple claims). Willingness to REFUTE own hypotheses when evidence demands demonstrates intellectual honesty and proper falsification discipline. EXEMPLARY - demonstrates how hypothesis testing should function across all stages. PASS."
