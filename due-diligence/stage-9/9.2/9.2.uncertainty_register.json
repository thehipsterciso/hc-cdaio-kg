      "decision_impact": "Cannot accurately assess SLA breach exposure or customer termination rights following failures. If contractual RTO is 4 hours but achievable RTO is 48 hours, customer has breach claim and termination right. Affects: (1) Liability quantification for major incidents (SLA credits, damages), (2) Insurance coverage assessment (insurer may deny if contractual commitments unrealistic), (3) Customer retention modeling (customers with unmet SLA commitments more likely to churn), (4) Capital allocation decisions (need to invest in redundancy to meet commitments or renegotiate commitments to match capability). MATERIALITY: Potential $10-50M+ annual SLA credit exposure if major incidents reveal systematic RTO gaps across customer base.",
      "what_would_reduce_uncertainty": "Access to: (1) Master service agreements and SLAs for top 50 customers by revenue, (2) Standard SLA terms by service tier (Managed Infrastructure vs Managed Operations vs Fanatical Support), (3) SLA breach and credit payout history (demonstrates actual vs contractual achievement), (4) Internal RTO/RPO targets documented in BCP/DR plans, (5) Customer escalation data showing SLA dispute frequency and outcomes.",
      "risk_of_false_confidence": "HIGH. If buyer assumes Rackspace meets stated RTOs because 'major MSP with enterprise customers', but reality is systematic RTO gaps causing customer dissatisfaction and churn risk, buyer overpays for deteriorating asset. December 2022 Exchange discontinuation suggests worst-case: When incident exceeds recovery capability, service is KILLED not recovered. Buyer assuming recoverable incidents may face unrecoverable ones requiring strategic discontinuations with 100% customer loss."

      "unknown": "Platform infrastructure DR capability - do billing, IAM, monitoring, and provisioning systems have tested recovery procedures, redundancy, or documented RTOs?",
      "type": "UNKNOWN",
      "decision_impact": "Cannot assess continuity risk for systems affecting $2.7B revenue realization (billing), all operations (IAM), and service quality (monitoring, provisioning). Stage 6.3 identifies these as 'SINGLE POINTS OF FAILURE' but doesn't confirm whether DR capabilities exist but are undisclosed, or don't exist at all. If capabilities don't exist: (1) Major platform failure could halt operations/revenue for days/weeks, (2) Cost to build DR capability post-acquisition = $10-50M+ for redundancy infrastructure across platforms, (3) Integration risk if buyer plans to migrate Rackspace platforms to buyer's infrastructure (cannot migrate critical systems without DR/rollback), (4) Insurance gap (platform failures may not be covered if 'failure to maintain reasonable controls'). If capabilities exist but undisclosed, uncertainty itself creates risk (cannot validate quality, cannot plan integration).",
      "what_would_reduce_uncertainty": "Access to: (1) IT architecture documentation showing platform redundancy (hot standby, geographic distribution, failover mechanisms), (2) DR test results for platform systems (when last tested, what scenarios tested, pass/fail outcomes), (3) Platform incident post-mortems showing recovery times achieved, (4) CapEx allocation for platform infrastructure (is redundancy being funded or deferred?), (5) Platform vendor SLAs (what are AWS/Azure/Google/VMware commitments that Rackspace depends on?), (6) SOC 2 Type II audit findings related to platform availability controls.",
      "risk_of_false_confidence": "CRITICAL. Platforms are INFRASTRUCTURE-CRITICAL but may be treated as 'internal IT' rather than 'customer-facing services' for continuity purposes. Common failure mode: Operations-focused teams extensively plan customer workload DR, but neglect internal platform DR assuming 'we'll figure it out if it breaks.' When platform fails, discover no tested procedures, no redundancy, no clear recovery path. Takes days/weeks to improvise recovery, during which operations paralyzed or revenue blocked. Buyer assuming platforms have enterprise-grade DR may face extended outages exceeding covenant/tolerance thresholds if assumption wrong."

      "type": "UNKNOWN",
      "decision_impact": "Cannot calibrate incident-driven churn models without empirical data. Stage 9.2 failure sequences estimate 15-50% churn from major incidents, but these are INFERENCES based on switching cost analysis and general industry patterns. Actual Rackspace churn following real incidents would provide: (1) Churn sensitivity coefficients (e.g., 'ransomware affecting 5% of customer base causes 2% total customer base churn'), (2) Churn timing patterns (immediate vs delayed, suggesting early warning indicators), (3) Customer segment differences (does government churn differently than commercial? Large enterprise vs mid-market?), (4) Competitive displacement patterns (where do churning customers go?). Affects: (1) Revenue forecasting under stress scenarios, (2) Insurance recovery expectations (if incident churn exceeds insurance coverage, self-insured for shortfall), (3) Acquisition valuation (buyer needs to haircut revenue for incident risk).",
      "what_would_reduce_uncertainty": "Access to: (1) Customer cohort analysis showing retention curves pre-incident vs post-incident, (2) Termination reason codes from churned customers (explicit incident citation), (3) Revenue from affected vs unaffected customers over 12-24 months post-incident (quantifies contagion), (4) Sales team win/loss data showing incidents cited in competitive losses, (5) Customer satisfaction or NPS scores pre/post incident (leading indicator of churn), (6) Insurance claims documentation quantifying revenue losses from incidents (insurers quantify for claim purposes).",
      "risk_of_false_confidence": "HIGH. If buyer assumes 'customers are sticky, incidents cause minor bump in churn', but reality is 30-50% churn from major incidents (per Stage 9.2 inferences), revenue projections overstated by 10-20% in years following incidents. With three incidents in 36 months (Exchange, ScienceLogic, CL0P) and potential fourth (future ransomware per Stage 9.2 sequence), compounding churn from recurring incidents creates STRUCTURAL REVENUE DECLINE beyond baseline market dynamics. Exchange service discontinuation (100% customer loss) demonstrates EXISTENCE PROOF that incident-driven churn can be TOTAL not incremental in extreme cases."

      "unknown": "Leadership incident response performance - do executives engage rapidly with delegated authority, or slowly with hierarchical escalation? Are decisions made hours vs days after initial failure?",
      "type": "UNKNOWN",
      "decision_impact": "Decision lag determines whether incidents are CONTAINED or AMPLIFIED. Fast response (T+minutes to T+hours): Early intervention prevents escalation, minimizes customer impact, preserves trust. Slow response (T+hours to T+days): Failure cascades unchecked, customer impact maximizes, trust destroyed, recovery harder/impossible. Stage 8.1 shows 4-day lag from Exchange 'connectivity issues' to ransomware confirmation - extended delay suggesting slow response. But insufficient data to determine if this is PATTERN or EXCEPTION. If pattern (leadership consistently slow to engage/decide): (1) All failure sequences in Stage 9.2 underestimate impact because assume some mitigation attempt, but slow response means failures run to completion unmitigated, (2) Cost of incidents 2-10X higher than with fast response (industry benchmarks), (3) Cultural issue requiring leadership change/restructuring to fix. If exception (Exchange was unusual), uncertainty remains whether future incidents handled faster.",
      "what_would_reduce_uncertainty": "Access to: (1) Incident timelines for all major incidents (T+0 detection, T+X executive notification, T+Y decision, T+Z action), (2) Executive calendars or war room logs during incidents (when did leadership actually engage?), (3) Organizational structure showing decision authority at different levels (who can decide what without escalation?), (4) Post-incident reviews identifying decision lag as contributing factor vs not mentioned, (5) Employee feedback on incident response culture (Glassdoor, internal surveys) - do staff report empowerment to act or requirement to escalate?, (6) Comparison to industry benchmarks (Google SRE practices, AWS incident response timelines).",
      "risk_of_false_confidence": "MEDIUM-HIGH. Organizational culture and leadership dynamics are HARD TO ASSESS from outside but CRITICAL TO EXECUTION. Buyer may assume 'large company with enterprise customers must have professional incident response', but December 2022 Exchange outcome (service discontinued) and delayed communications suggest potential gaps. If buyer assumes fast response but reality is slow, all continuity plans and recovery targets are FICTION - by time leadership mobilizes, damage already done. May require post-acquisition leadership changes or cultural transformation to achieve response speed buyer expects."

      "decision_impact": "Insurance significantly affects incident cost absorption capacity. December 2022 Exchange recovered $5.4M from $10.8-12M costs = 50% recovery rate (Stage 8.1). Suggests either: (1) Under-insured (limits too low), (2) Exclusions applied (unpatched vulnerability? failure to maintain controls?), or (3) Revenue losses not covered (business interruption limits). Cannot model incident cost exposure without knowing: (1) Current coverage limits and deductibles, (2) Exclusions that might apply to future incidents (ransomware exclusion? unpatched vulnerability exclusion? third-party vendor exclusion?), (3) Renewal terms given incident history (will insurer renew? At what premium? With what restrictions?). Affects: (1) Capital reserves required for self-insured portion of incidents, (2) Risk tolerance for continuity investments (if well-insured, can accept more risk; if poorly insured, must reduce risk), (3) Acquisition financing (lender may require specific cyber insurance as credit condition).",
      "what_would_reduce_uncertainty": "Access to: (1) Current cyber insurance policy with limits, deductibles, exclusions, (2) Insurance claim history showing what was covered vs denied for past incidents, (3) Insurance broker communications about renewal terms and carrier appetite, (4) Underwriter risk assessment reports (how do they view Rackspace risk profile?), (5) Alternative quotes or declination letters if incumbent non-renewing, (6) Board-level insurance committee discussions about adequacy of coverage.",
      "risk_of_false_confidence": "MEDIUM. Buyer assuming 'cyber insurance transfers cyber risk' may face reality that insurance provides only PARTIAL transfer (50% recovery per Exchange) and increasingly EXPENSIVE transfer (premiums rising 200-500% per Stage 9.2). With three incidents in 36 months, Rackspace may be approaching UNINSURABLE status where no carrier provides coverage at any price. If buyer plans to rely on insurance for incident cost absorption, but insurance non-renewals or becomes prohibitively expensive, buyer must either: (1) Self-insure (requires significantly larger capital reserves), (2) Reduce risk through massive security/continuity investments (expensive), or (3) Accept higher incident frequency/severity (unacceptable for enterprise customers)."

      "type": "UNKNOWN",
      "decision_impact": "UK Sovereign Services are ARCHITECTURALLY ISOLATED per Stage 1.5 - cannot leverage global resources. FedRAMP government services have entity-specific authorization. Creates potential for INCONSISTENT CONTINUITY CAPABILITY across geography/segments. If US commercial has strong DR but UK Sovereign has weak DR (due to isolation limiting resources), incident affecting UK could be catastrophic while US unaffected. Or vice versa. Cannot assess total continuity risk without knowing segment-specific capabilities. Affects: (1) Segment valuation (well-protected segments worth more than vulnerable segments), (2) Incident impact modeling (does incident affect all segments or localized?), (3) Integration planning (buyer may want to consolidate/rationalize segments with different continuity postures), (4) Capital allocation (invest in strengthening weak segments or divest them?).",

Failover paths?), (3) Support team sizing and expertise by region (can UK team handle UK incidents without US help?), (4) Historical incidents segmented by geography/customer type (where do failures occur? How handled?), (5) Customer SLA terms by segment (do government customers have stricter RTOs than commercial?), (6) CapEx allocation by segment (which segments getting continuity investment vs deferred?).",
      "risk_of_false_confidence": "MEDIUM. Buyer may assume 'global company has consistent capabilities everywhere', but multi-entity structure (100+ entities per Stage 1.1) and sovereign isolation requirements create FRAGMENTATION. UK Sovereign explicitly cannot use global resources (Stage 1.5, Stage 6.3). FedRAMP government explicitly uses entity-specific authorization (Stage 1.5). Creates potential for POCKETS OF WEAKNESS where single-entity or isolated segments lack resources/redundancy of larger organization. Incident striking weak segment could destroy that segment (Exchange precedent) even if rest of company unaffected."
