CANNOT SUBSTITUTE with non-US citizens without violating FedRAMP requirements. CANNOT OPERATE government services without this specific team - authorization is ENTITY-SPECIFIC and TEAM-SPECIFIC. Team size likely SMALL relative to operational scope (estimated 10-30 personnel for 800+ NIST controls + customer operations + incident response). NO DISCLOSED BACKUP TEAM or succession plan - if key members unavailable, remaining team insufficient for 24/7/365 continuous monitoring requirements. CLEARANCE REQUIREMENTS for certain customers (DoD, Intelligence Community) further constrain replacement pool - must have SECRET/TOP SECRET clearances taking 6-18 months to obtain.",
      "stress_scenario": "SCENARIO: 5-10 senior FedRAMP security team members depart simultaneously (poaching by competitor, burnout from incident workload, dissatisfaction with compensation). IMMEDIATE IMPACT (T+0 to T+30 days): Continuous monitoring gaps appear - cannot maintain 24/7 coverage with depleted team, incident response degrades - critical finding reporting SLA breaches (1 hour requirement), compliance evidence generation slows - annual assessment preparation at risk. SECONDARY IMPACT (T+30 to T+90 days): FedRAMP findings accumulate - missing evidence, delayed reports = POA&Ms required, JAB/agency concerns raised - authorization review triggered by control failures, customer confidence erodes - government procurement officers

 hear about team departures and authorization stress. TERTIARY IMPACT (T+90 days to T+12 months): Authorization SUSPENSION risk if findings not remediated timely, government customers invoke 'termination for convenience' rather than risk disruption (estimated 20-40% immediate terminations = $54-164M revenue loss per Stage 9.2), remaining team further stressed by departures and customer churn creating MORE attrition (death spiral), Apollo forced to choose: (1) Pay massive retention bonuses to remaining team (expensive, treats symptom), (2) Accept government revenue loss and segment exit, (3) Sell government business to US buyer who can staff properly (distressed sale at discount).",
