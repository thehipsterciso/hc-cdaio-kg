If comprehensive documentation existed, Rackspace would BENEFIT from disclosing it: (1) Recruitment advantage ('join us, we have great documentation and onboarding'), (2) Investor confidence ('operations not dependent on specific individuals'), (3) Operational resilience ('can handle personnel turnover'), (4) Valuation support ('systematic not heroic operations'). Absence suggests: Either (1) Documentation doesn't exist (knowledge truly concentrated), or (2) Documentation exists but inadequate (not comprehensive enough to matter), or (3) Documentation exists but unmaintained (stale, unreliable). All three interpretations concerning. Combined with explicit Stage 6.3 statement 'platforms contain UNDOCUMENTED LOGIC' and Stage 4.5 'legacy system custodians possess UNDOCUMENTED operational knowledge', absence of documentation evidence VALIDATES hypothesis rather than weakens it.",

Absence suggests: Redundancy DOESN'T EXIST despite organizational scale (~7,000 employees inferred from $709M SG&A). Three CEOs three years PROVES CEO role lacks succession plan - each transition improvised. Stage 4.1 explicitly states 'NO OPERATING COMMITTEE' - proves authority not distributed.

Absence after three incidents in 36 months particularly concerning - suggests either (1) Retention IS problem but undisclosed, or (2) Retention not tracked/measured (worse - unaware of problem). Stage 4.5 explicitly rates burnout risk HIGH to EXTREME across five organizational zones. Three CEOs three years demonstrates LEADERSHIP attrition. Trustpilot 'worse' 2024 suggests OPERATIONS attrition creating customer-visible degradation. Exchange service DISCONTINUATION may reflect insufficient personnel post-ransomware.
