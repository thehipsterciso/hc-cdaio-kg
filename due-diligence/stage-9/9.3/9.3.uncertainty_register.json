      "decision_impact": "Cannot calibrate human capital risk models without empirical attrition data. Affects: (1) Workforce cost modeling - if attrition 25-40% annually need 3-4X hiring budget vs 10-15% baseline assumption, (2) Operational continuity risk - high attrition in FedRAMP/VMware/platform roles creates authorization/service jeopardy, (3) Retention program ROI - cannot design targeted interventions without knowing who leaves when and why, (4) Acquisition integration planning - if buyer inherits high-attrition workforce, must factor replacement costs and knowledge loss. MATERIALITY: If specialist roles (FedRAMP, UK Sovereign, platform architects) experiencing 30-50% annual attrition vs assumed 10-15%, replacement costs $5-15M annually higher, operational risk 3-5X higher, integration timeline 12-24 months longer.",

      "risk_of_false_confidence": "HIGH. If buyer assumes 'normal MSP turnover 15-20%' but reality is specialized roles 30-50% and accelerating, underestimates: (1) Replacement costs (continuous recruiting/training), (2) Knowledge loss velocity (expertise walking out faster than documentation), (3) Capacity gaps (extended vacancies during 6-12 month backfill), (4) Death spiral risk (high attrition drives overload driving more attrition). Three CEOs three years PROVES attrition problem exists at leadership. Stage 4.5 burnout risks HIGH to EXTREME suggest attrition likely above industry baseline."

If platforms managed by SINGLE INDIVIDUALS (worst case): (1) Vacation/illness creates incident response gap - no backup available, (2) Departure creates UNRECOVERABLE knowledge loss - tribal knowledge walks out, (3) Hiring/retention becomes EXISTENTIAL - losing billing architect halts $2.7B revenue realization. If 2-3 person teams (moderate risk): (1) Some redundancy but insufficient for sustained crisis, (2) Knowledge transfer possible but incomplete, (3) Team attrition still creates severe risk. If deeper benches 5-10+ (low risk): (1) Adequate redundancy for continuity, (2) Knowledge distributed reducing concentration. Affects acquisition integration: Buyer planning to migrate platforms to buyer infrastructure needs to know if Rackspace architects available to support migration or if tribal knowledge prevents.",

Strong inference platforms managed by 1-3 individuals each. If buyer assumes 'large IT organization has deep platform benches' but reality is single architect dependencies, discovers post-acquisition: Platform changes frozen (too risky), incidents unrecoverable (no expertise), architect retention EXISTENTIAL (must pay whatever demanded). Cannot migrate platforms to buyer infrastructure (knowledge walks if architects leave)."

FedRAMP: If team 10-15 personnel (minimal for 24/7 coverage + 800+ controls) vs 30-50 (adequate redundancy), determines: (1) Authorization sustainability - minimal team one incident away from control failure, (2) Retention fragility - 3-5 departures catastrophic for minimal team, 10-15 departures manageable for larger team, (3) Expansion capacity - minimal team cannot support new government customers. UK Sovereign: If team 5-10 personnel (minimal) vs 20-30 (adequate), determines segment viability - minimal team insufficient for growth, one major incident or attrition wave forces segment exit.

UNKNOWABLE because individual burnout thresholds vary - some employees sustain heroics for years, others months. But TREND CLEAR: situation degrading not improving.

Exchange service DISCONTINUATION demonstrates - appeared manageable until decided unrecoverable. CEO churn demonstrates - each CEO appears capable until departs/replaced.
