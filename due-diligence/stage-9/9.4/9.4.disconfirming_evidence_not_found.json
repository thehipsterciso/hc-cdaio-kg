If diversification programs existed, Rackspace would BENEFIT from disclosing: (1) Risk mitigation messaging to customers ('we protect you from vendor lock-in'), (2) Investor confidence ('concentrated dependencies being addressed'), (3) Vendor negotiation leverage ('we can switch if terms unfavorable'), (4) Operational resilience ('failover capability reduces downtime'). Absence after three incidents in 36 months (Exchange, ScienceLogic, CL0P) particularly concerning - suggests either (1) Diversification NOT PRIORITY despite incident history, or (2) Diversification ATTEMPTED but FAILED (worse - proves infeasible), or (3) Diversification RECOGNIZED as economically unviable (accepted risk). Combined with Stage 6.2 'multi-cloud flexibility is MARKETING FICTION' and Stage 9.4 concentration quantification (triopoly 61% revenue, monopoly 39% revenue), absence VALIDATES concentration as PERMANENT STRUCTURAL condition not temporary tactical issue.",

Absence after Broadcom $100-210M price shock (Stage 6.2) proves: Leverage ABSENT when most needed - could not negotiate reduction, could not threaten to switch (economically impossible), FORCED to accept 200-300% increase. If volume discounts existed, pricing would DECREASE as Rackspace scales (buying more = better pricing) - OPPOSITE observed (Broadcom pricing INCREASED).

Absence validates OPPOSITE trend: Stage 5.1 shows CapEx DECLINING 25% (NOT investing in internal development), Stage 6.2 shows vendor costs INCREASING (Broadcom shock $100-210M), Stage 6.3 shows internal platforms FRAGILE with single points of failure (cannot replace vendors when internal systems weak). CRITICAL FINDING: Business model architecture REQUIRES vendor dependency - managed services means managing VENDOR INFRASTRUCTURE for customers. Cannot eliminate hyperscaler dependency (customers chose AWS/Azure/Google), cannot eliminate VMware dependency (customers run on VMware VMs).
