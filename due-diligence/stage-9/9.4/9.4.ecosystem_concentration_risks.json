ZERO alternatives exist - cannot deliver Public Cloud managed services without hyperscaler infrastructure. Customer workloads RUN ON hyperscaler platforms using hyperscaler-proprietary services. TRIOPOLY POWER: Three vendors control entire segment revenue. Can independently or collectively: (1) Raise partner costs (reduce credits from 10-15% to 5%), (2) Change partner terms unilaterally (restrict resale, modify billing), (3) Compete directly with Rackspace (AWS/Azure Managed Services undercut Rackspace), (4) Prioritize direct customers over partners during capacity constraints.",
      "why_it_matters_under_stress": "CORRELATED INCENTIVE TO DISINTERMEDIATE: All three hyperscalers benefit from eliminating Rackspace middleman and capturing customers direct. AWS margin on direct customer >partner margin. SEQUENTIAL FAILURE RISK: If ONE hyperscaler reduces partner credits 5%, Rackspace Public Cloud margin compresses from 10.4% to 5.4% (Stage 9.2) approaching unprofitability. Forces price increase to customers. Customers evaluate alternatives, discover AWS/Azure-direct cheaper. Churn accelerates across ALL hyperscalers not just one. CONCENTRATION AMPLIFIES POWER ASYMMETRY: Rackspace depends on hyperscalers for 100% of segment, hyperscalers view Rackspace as ONE of thousands of partners generating <0.1% of hyperscaler revenue. Expendable. Cannot threaten to switch vendors - NO ALTERNATIVES. STRESS SCENARIO: Economic downturn → hyperscalers reduce partner programs to protect direct sales → Rackspace margin evaporates → must exit Public Cloud segment → loses 61% of revenue.",
      "correlated_failure_risk": "SHARED CLOUD OUTAGE: Major internet infrastructure failure (BGP, DNS, DDoS) affects multiple hyperscalers simultaneously. Rackspace customers across AWS+Azure+Google DOWN. Customer perception: 'Cloud is unreliable, Rackspace cannot protect us.' COORDINATED POLICY CHANGE: Hyperscalers coordinate (formally or informally) to reduce partner economics industry-wide. Precedent: Software vendors (Microsoft, Adobe, others) simultaneously shifted perpetual → subscription creating industry-wide margin pressure. TALENT POACHING: All three hyperscalers recruit Rackspace engineers for customer migration support teams. Coordinated talent drain faster than Rackspace can backfill. REGULATORY: If regulators restrict hyperscaler partner programs (anti-competitive concerns), affects all three simultaneously.

Already exercised power via 200-300% price increase = $100-210M annual cost (Stage 6.2). Can increase further, restrict licensing, change support terms unilaterally. Rackspace CANNOT EXIT - migration cost $200-500M + customer churn 30-50% ($316-528M revenue loss) exceeds staying despite price shock. VENDOR HOSTAGE (Stage 6.3).",
      "why_it_matters_under_stress": "BROADCOM OPTIMIZES FOR DIRECT CUSTOMERS: Broadcom strategy post-acquisition is extract maximum value from installed base via pricing power and eliminate low-value partnerships. Rackspace is INTERMEDIARY not end customer - Broadcom prefers enterprise direct relationships. SEQUENTIAL EXTRACTION: First extraction $100-210M (already occurred). Second extraction could be: Further price increase 50-100%, restrictive licensing terms (cannot provision new infrastructure), forced migration to Broadcom cloud platform (exit partner model). Each extraction forces Rackspace choice: Absorb (unprofitable), pass through (customer churn), exit segment (revenue loss). STRESS SCENARIO: Private Cloud already declining 13% YoY (Stage 5.1). Broadcom price shock accelerates decline to 20-30% YoY. Segment becomes UNVIABLE within 24-36 months. Must discontinue (Exchange precedent Stage 8.1), losing 39% revenue and 40-50% operating income.

Affects Rackspace + all VMware MSPs simultaneously. Creates talent/customer bidding war among displaced partners.

Partnership terms reset, pricing uncertainty, potential forced migrations. Rackspace faces 6-18 month uncertainty period during which customers defect.

Creates ISOLATED FAILURE DOMAINS - one jurisdiction vendor failure doesn't cascade to others BUT also cannot be rescued by others. SEGMENT-SPECIFIC EXIT RISK: Vendor failure in one jurisdiction may force EXIT of that segment vs fix (Exchange precedent). UK Sovereign vendor failure → segment too small (<$135M) to justify finding alternative → exit. FedRAMP vendor failure → government authorization jeopardizes $270-410M revenue → may force government business divestiture. COMPLIANCE VENDOR SCARCITY: Fewer vendors serve compliance markets (FedRAMP, UK Sovereign) vs commercial. Limited options when vendor relationship fails.
