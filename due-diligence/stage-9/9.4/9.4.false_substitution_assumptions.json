MIGRATION COST per customer $50-500K+ (re-architect, re-deploy, re-test, re-certify). Customer chose SPECIFIC hyperscaler for reasons (compliance, integrations, existing ecosystem) - Rackspace cannot unilaterally switch. TIME TO MIGRATE workload: 3-12 months minimum.

SCENARIO 2: Azure CSP program terminates Rackspace partnership (precedent: Microsoft terminated partners before). Can move $500-700M Azure customers to AWS? NO - same portability problem, customer backlash, churn wave. SCENARIO 3: One hyperscaler major outage 24+ hours - can failover customers to alternative?

At scale, monitoring becomes DEEPLY INTEGRATED into operations - alert orchestration, ticket automation, customer portals, billing integration, capacity planning.
