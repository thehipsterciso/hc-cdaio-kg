CONDITIONS requiring compliance: (1) Security controls questionnaire completed truthfully - if Rackspace overstated security posture to get coverage, claim deniable, (2) Breach notification timing - must notify insurer within 24-72 hours or coverage voidable, (3) Cooperation with investigation - must preserve evidence, not make public statements without insurer consent.",
