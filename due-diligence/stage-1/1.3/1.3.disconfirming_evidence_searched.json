      "search_conducted": "Searched Rackspace press releases, investor presentations, earnings call transcripts (via news summaries), and financial news for: 'integration complete', 'synergies realized', 'consolidation finished', 'Datapipe integration', 'Onica integration', 'platform migration complete', 'systems unified'. Reviewed corporate newsroom for transformation success stories. Searched for cost synergy quantification ($X million saved from integration).",
      "why_relevant_to_hypothesis": "If found, would DISCONFIRM H2 (structural debt from incomplete transformations). Evidence of completed integrations would show company successfully finishes what it starts, contradicting pattern of partial changes.",
      "finding": "NOT FOUND. No announcements of completed post-merger integrations. No disclosures of achieved synergies from $1.7B acquisition spend (Datapipe, Onica, TriCore, RelationEdge). Absence is SIGNIFICANT - successful integrations are typically trumpeted in earnings calls and investor presentations ('$50M in synergies delivered ahead of schedule'). Silence suggests: (1) Integrations incomplete, (2) Synergies not realized, or (3) Results disappointing and not worth promoting.",
      "impact": "Supports H2. Absence of integration success stories combined with persistence of separate legal entities (documented in Stage 1.1) indicates company acquired assets but failed to extract synergies through consolidation. Structural debt accumulates."

      "evidence_type": "Management communications describing current structure as 'optimal' or 'by design' rather than historical artifact",
      "search_conducted": "Searched investor presentations, CEO letters to shareholders, strategic vision statements, and analyst interviews for management characterizing current entity structure, ownership structure, or debt structure as deliberate strategic design. Looked for statements like: 'Our multi-entity structure enables X', 'Apollo partnership provides strategic value beyond capital', 'Maintaining public listing while PE-controlled creates unique advantages'.",
      "why_relevant_to_hypothesis": "If found, would DISCONFIRM H1 (complexity driven by history). Evidence that management views complexity as strategic advantage rather than burden would show current structure is intentional, not accident of history.",
      "finding": "NOT FOUND. No management statements celebrating structural complexity or characterizing it as strategic advantage. Instead found: (1) Repeated cost-cutting and workforce reductions (2021, 2023) suggesting focus on efficiency not complexity-as-advantage, (2) Debt refinancing necessity in 2024 suggesting debt structure is burden not choice, (3) Stock price collapse and NASDAQ listing risk suggesting public-private hybrid structure is problematic not advantageous. Management actions reveal REVEALED PREFERENCE: complexity is problem to be managed, not asset to be leveraged.",
      "impact": "Supports H1. Management behavior (cost-cutting, debt refinancing, operational focus) indicates complexity is CONSTRAINT imposed by history, not strategic design for current operations."

      "evidence_type": "Evidence of successful 'temporary structure unwinding' - cases where interim solutions were retired on schedule",
      "search_conducted": "Searched for announcements of: 'Inception entities dissolved', 'Apollo reducing stake below 50%', 'Debt paid down to target levels', 'Hosted Exchange assets redeployed', 'Acquisition entities consolidated and merged into parent', 'Legacy systems retired', 'Transformation program completed'. Looked for evidence of structures being successfully removed after serving temporary purpose.",
      "why_relevant_to_hypothesis": "If found, would DISCONFIRM H3 (temporary structures hardening into permanent). Evidence of successful unwinding would show company has ability and discipline to complete transitions and retire interim structures.",
      "finding": "NOT FOUND. No evidence of temporary structures being successfully unwound: (1) Inception entities persist 9 years post-acquisition (2016-2025), (2) Apollo stake unchanged at 53-57% (down slightly from 58% in 2020 but still majority), (3) Debt quantum maintained through refinancings since 2016 LBO, (4) Hosted Exchange stranded assets not explicitly redeployed per any announcement, (5) Acquired entities not consolidated (still separate per subsidiary lists), (6) No announcements of legacy system retirements or consolidation completions. Pattern is: structures PERSIST indefinitely once created.",
      "impact": "Strongly supports H3. Company demonstrates INABILITY to unwind temporary structures. Once created, structures become permanent due to: (1) Unwinding costs exceeding perceived benefits, (2) Management bandwidth consumed by firefighting not unwinding, (3) Financial constraints preventing investments in cleanup, (4) Hidden dependencies making removal risky."

      "search_conducted": "Searched for: (1) Announcements characterizing 2021 layoffs as 'one-time restructuring' enabling future growth, (2) Periods of workforce GROWTH following 2021 cuts indicating stabilization, (3) Management statements that 2023 layoffs were unexpected/unplanned vs continuation of ongoing cost reduction, (4) Evidence that post-layoff headcount matched business needs without further cuts.",
      "why_relevant_to_hypothesis": "If found, would DISCONFIRM H3 (temporary solutions becoming permanent pattern). Evidence of successful one-time restructuring would show 2021 cuts were discrete event, not beginning of repeated reduction pattern.",
      "finding": "NOT FOUND (CONTRADICTED). Found REPEATED workforce reductions: 2021 (10% / 700 workers), 2023 (4% / 275 workers). Each time management likely characterized as 'one-time' or necessary adjustment, but recurrence reveals ONGOING STRUCTURAL PROBLEM. No evidence of workforce growth between cuts - suggests company in continuous downsize mode. Pattern indicates: (1) Business challenges are structural not cyclical, (2) Each cut is insufficient to reach equilibrium, (3) Company is in managed decline (shrink-to-profitability strategy).",
      "impact": "Strongly supports H3. 'One-time' restructurings are RECURRING pattern, indicating 'temporary' cost actions are permanent new baseline that must be repeatedly reduced as business continues to deteriorate."

      "search_conducted": "Searched Apollo's and Rackspace's statements at time of 2020 IPO for: (1) Explicit language that Apollo intends to remain majority owner indefinitely, (2) Strategic rationale for permanent PE-backed public company model, (3) Comparison to other permanent PE-controlled public companies as precedent, (4) Apollo fund lifecycle and expected holding period disclosures. Reviewed IPO prospectus summaries and analyst commentary from 2020.",
      "why_relevant_to_hypothesis": "If found, would DISCONFIRM H3 (temporary structure hardening). Evidence that Apollo/management described structure as permanent by design would show current state is intended, not failed exit attempt.",
      "finding": "NOT FOUND (IMPLIED OPPOSITE). IPO timing and structure suggest Apollo intended PARTIAL EXIT with future full exit optionality: (1) IPO raised $703M providing Apollo some liquidity after 4 years of ownership (2016-2020), (2) Apollo's typical fund lifecycle is 10 years (Fund VIII from ~2013 would target exits by 2023), suggesting IPO was step toward full exit, (3) Stock price performance (fell 22% on day 1, now down 97% from IPO price) indicates market viewed Apollo's retained majority negatively - if structure was strategic, market would value 'sponsor backing', (4) Silence on long-term Apollo intentions suggests intentional ambiguity to preserve exit options. INTERPRETATION: Apollo retained majority because market would not support full exit at acceptable valuation, not because structure is strategically optimal.",
      "impact": "Supports H3. IPO structure was COMPROMISE between (1) Apollo's desire for liquidity/exit, and (2) Market's unwillingness to pay for full exit. Apollo is now STUCK at 53-57% - neither fully in (would require taking company private) nor fully out (would require selling at massive loss)."

      "evidence_type": "Evidence of operational rationale for maintaining separate acquired company entities (regulatory, customer, or tax requirements)",

      "why_relevant_to_hypothesis": "If found, would DISCONFIRM H1 and H2 (complexity is historical artifact / incomplete integration). Evidence of operational necessity would show separate entities serve current purpose, not just historical legacy.",
      "finding": "NOT FOUND. No evidence of regulatory, customer, or tax requirements forcing entity separation. (1) Stage 1.1 H3 found NO structural regulatory licenses that would be entity-specific, (2) No customer contract requirements disclosed mandating specific legal entity as service provider, (3) No tax disclosures explaining entity separation necessity, (4) Industry practice (cloud MSPs) does not typically require separate entities per acquired company - peers consolidate acquisitions. Absence of operational rationale suggests separate entities exist because consolidation was NOT COMPLETED, not because separation is required.",
      "impact": "Supports H1 and H2. Separate acquired entities are HISTORICAL ARTIFACTS from incomplete post-merger integrations, not operational requirements. Could theoretically be consolidated but company lacks resources/bandwidth/priority to execute consolidation."
