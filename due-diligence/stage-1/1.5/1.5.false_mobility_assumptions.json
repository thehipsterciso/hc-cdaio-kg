UK government/regulated industry business requires RACKSPACE LIMITED entity with UK-isolated infrastructure (UK Sovereign Services). China business requires China entity with China data storage (Cybersecurity Law). EU business requires EU operations with GDPR-compliant data transfers. Singapore requires Singapore entity. Consolidation into single jurisdiction is LEGALLY IMPOSSIBLE without exiting multiple markets representing material revenue.",

Reality: Consolidation triggers loss of FedRAMP (government customers lost), UK Sovereign Services (UK government/NHS/regulated industry lost), China operations (China market exit), EU customer non-compliance.

Re-authorization process takes 12-18 months with no guarantee of approval. During re-authorization gap, federal government customers CANNOT use services and will migrate to alternative FedRAMP-authorized providers. DoD FOCI review (expanded May 2024 to all contracts >$5M) adds additional 6-12 months if acquirer is foreign entity, and may be DENIED if foreign ownership creates unacceptable national security risks.",

Reality: Government customers immediately lose authorized service provider upon ownership change. 100% government customer churn during 12-18 month re-authorization process.

Integration with non-UK operations would IMMEDIATELY VIOLATE UK government, NHS, police, and regulated industry requirements.

Consolidation or relocation breaks multiple contractual, regulatory, and operational dependencies simultaneously.",

UK sovereign cannot be integrated with global operations. China business cannot be integrated with non-China operations. Integration synergies severely limited.

FOCI mitigation options are HIGHLY RESTRICTIVE: (1) Special Security Agreement with proxy board - foreign owner has NO operational control over government business (defeats acquisition purpose), (2) Voting Trust Agreement - government business operated independently with no foreign influence, (3) Complete divestiture of government business.

If FOCI mitigation required, foreign owner has NO CONTROL over government business (proxy board model) or must DIVEST government business entirely. Government revenue stream ($X million unknown but material) is AT RISK for foreign acquirer.

Reality: Framework is temporary and legally fragile. May be invalidated 2-3 years post-acquisition, forcing costly restructuring of EU-U.S. data flows. If invalidated, Rackspace may need to COMPLETELY SEPARATE EU operations from U.S. operations with no data transfers, increasing operational cost and complexity.
