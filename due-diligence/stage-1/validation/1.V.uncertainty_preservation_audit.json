Claim_type labels (FACT vs INFERENCE) consistently distinguished documented evidence from analytical interpretation. Uncertainty preservation is EXCELLENT and Investment Committee-appropriate.",

Stage 1 provides SUFFICIENT FOUNDATION for Investment Committee decision on whether to proceed to Stage 2 diligence, with clear roadmap of what must be discovered to complete investment decision."
