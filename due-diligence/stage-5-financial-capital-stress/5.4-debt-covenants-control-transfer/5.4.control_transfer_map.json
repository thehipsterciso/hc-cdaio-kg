BREACH OCCURS WHEN: EBITDA declines faster than debt paydown (revenue decline + margin compression reduces EBITDA), OR one-time charges reduce EBITDA (restructuring, asset impairments), OR debt increases (PIK interest, incremental borrowing). ESTIMATED TIMING: 6-15 months given current trajectory (revenue declining 7% YoY, operating margin -6.4% before D&A, negative operating leverage).",

Lenders gain: (1) VETO RIGHTS over material decisions (CapEx above threshold, hiring/firing executives, asset sales, vendor changes), (2) APPROVAL RIGHTS for ordinary course expenditures above specified limits (e.g., $1-5M per transaction), (3) RIGHT TO APPOINT turnaround consultant or Chief Restructuring Officer (CRO) at company expense, (4) RIGHT TO ACCELERATE entire $1.3B debt (demand immediate repayment), (5) RIGHT TO FORECLOSE on collateral ('substantially all assets' of borrower and guarantors), (6) BOARD OBSERVER RIGHTS (attend board meetings, review materials, no vote but influence).",

All cash frozen except lender-approved ordinary course. (2) STRATEGIC DECISIONS: Cannot pursue M&A, divestitures, major contracts, or restructuring without lender pre-approval. Lenders can BLOCK any transaction. (3) OPERATIONAL DECISIONS: Cannot make material changes to business model, product portfolio, customer segments, or go-to-market without lender consent. (4) CAPITAL STRUCTURE: Cannot raise new debt, issue equity (if dilutive to lenders' recovery), or refinance without lender approval. (5) PERSONNEL: Senior executive hiring/firing requires lender consultation or approval. CRO appointment gives lenders DIRECT OPERATIONAL CONTROL through management proxy.",

Credit agreement typically provides 30-60 day CURE PERIOD for financial covenant breaches (can cure by raising equity, selling assets, or improving EBITDA). If not cured within grace period, event of default becomes permanent. Lenders can exercise remedies immediately after cure period expires OR waive default in exchange for AMENDMENT (fees, higher interest rate, stricter terms, equity warrants, operational covenants). TYPICAL TIMELINE: Breach detected at quarter-end → 15-30 days for covenant calculation and reporting → 30-60 day cure period → Lender negotiation 30-90 days → Amendment or acceleration.

Tested quarterly. BREACH OCCURS WHEN: EBITDA declines (revenue loss + margin compression) WHILE interest expense remains fixed or increases (cash interest on $1.3B debt estimated $100-150M annually at 8-12%). CRITICAL: Interest coverage deteriorates FASTER than leverage ratio when EBITDA collapses but debt remains constant. MORE LIKELY TO BREACH FIRST than leverage ratio if revenue collapse accelerates. ESTIMATED TIMING: 6-12 months if EBITDA declines 20-30% from customer exodus (faster than leverage ratio breach).",

Interest coverage breach is HARDER TO CURE than leverage breach because: (1) Cannot cure by debt paydown (reducing debt increases coverage ratio, but requires cash company doesn't have), (2) Can only cure by EBITDA improvement (requires revenue growth or margin expansion, both unlikely given trajectory), (3) Or equity injection from Apollo (expensive, dilutive, signals distress). CURE PROBABILITY: LOW if breach occurs. More likely to result in amendment negotiations or restructuring than cure. TIMELINE: 2-5 months from breach to lender control.",
