      "mechanism": "Excess Cash Flow Sweep - Forced Debt Prepayment from Positive Cash Generation",
      "why_it_is_hidden": "Excess cash flow sweep provisions are BURIED in mandatory prepayment sections of credit agreements, not headline terms. MECHANISM: If company generates positive free cash flow in any year, must prepay debt with 50-100% of excess cash flow (percentage depends on Total Leverage Ratio—higher leverage = higher sweep percentage). DEFINITION MANIPULATION: 'Excess cash flow' calculated as: Adjusted EBITDA minus cash taxes, cash interest, CapEx, working capital changes, and permitted investments. CRITICALLY: Lenders control DEFINITION through 'adjustments' to EBITDA (adding back restructuring costs, one-time charges, stock-based comp, etc.). Lenders can DISALLOW add-backs in excess cash flow calculation, forcing MORE cash to debt prepayment. HIDDEN BECAUSE: (1) Only triggers if FCF positive (company currently cash-burn negative, so not immediately relevant), (2) Percentage varies by leverage tier (not fixed), (3) Calculation complexity obscures true cash retention, (4) Management may not realize lenders can contest EBITDA adjustments.",
      "stress_trigger": "If company improves operations and generates positive FCF (e.g., $50M annually), excess cash flow sweep forces $25-50M debt prepayment (50-100% depending on leverage). PREVENTS CASH ACCUMULATION for strategic uses. If company wants to retain cash for acquisition, investment, or buffer: BLOCKED by sweep provision. Must prepay debt first. IMPLICATION: Cannot transition from distress to growth—any positive cash generation is CAPTURED by lenders until debt paid down to low leverage levels (typically <3.0x Total Leverage Ratio for sweep to reduce to 0%).",
      "control_consequence": "LENDERS CONTROL CASH DEPLOYMENT even when company performing WELL. Paradox: Company improves performance → generates cash → lenders claim cash for debt paydown → cannot invest in growth → performance stagnates. Creates DEBT TRAP: cash generation doesn't benefit equity (Apollo) or strategic flexibility, only reduces debt. Apollo's equity has NO CASH RETURN POTENTIAL until debt substantially reduced. Management cannot pursue growth investments without lender waiver (which requires fees/concessions). HIDDEN GOVERNANCE: Lenders control capital allocation through mechanical cash sweep, not explicit approval rights.",

      "why_it_is_hidden": "Covenant calculations (Total Leverage Ratio, Interest Coverage Ratio) use 'Adjusted EBITDA' not GAAP EBITDA. Credit agreement DEFINES 'Adjusted EBITDA' with extensive add-backs: (1) Restructuring charges (unlimited or capped at $X), (2) Non-cash charges (stock-based comp, asset impairments, goodwill write-offs), (3) Pro forma adjustments for acquisitions/dispositions, (4) 'Run-rate' cost savings from restructuring (can add back $X of projected savings before realized), (5) One-time items (litigation settlements, regulatory penalties, integration costs), (6) Other adjustments as agreed by lenders. CRITICALLY: 'As agreed by lenders' clause gives lenders DISCRETION to allow or disallow add-backs. HIDDEN BECAUSE: Add-backs inflate EBITDA for covenant calculations, creating ARTIFICIAL COMPLIANCE. Company may report covenant compliance publicly while ACTUAL CASH-BASED EBITDA is much lower. Lenders can WITHDRAW approval of add-backs at any time, causing INSTANT covenant breach.",
      "stress_trigger": "If company takes $50M goodwill impairment or $30M restructuring charge: Can add back to Adjusted EBITDA for covenants IF lenders approve. If lenders DISAPPROVE (e.g., restructuring not delivering promised savings), add-back denied and EBITDA declines $30-50M. Total Leverage Ratio SPIKES (debt constant, EBITDA down). Covenant breach occurs. TIMING: Lenders review add-backs QUARTERLY during compliance certificate review. Can challenge add-backs retroactively, claiming 'pro forma adjustments not reasonable' or 'cost savings not achieved.' Creates UNCERTAINTY—management believes in compliance, lenders dispute calculation, breach declared.",
      "control_consequence": "LENDERS CONTROL COVENANT COMPLIANCE through EBITDA definition discretion. Even if company's cash performance improving, lenders can manufacture covenant breach by disallowing add-backs. Creates NEGOTIATION LEVERAGE: Management wants add-back approved → Lenders demand concessions (fees, operational changes, reporting requirements) as quid pro quo for approval. HIDDEN GOVERNANCE: Covenant compliance is NEGOTIATED quarterly, not mechanical. Lenders use add-back discretion to extract ongoing concessions without formal amendment. Management operates under LENDER SUPERVISION disguised as technical covenant calculation.",
