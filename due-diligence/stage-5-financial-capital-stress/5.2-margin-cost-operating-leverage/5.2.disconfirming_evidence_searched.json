      "search_target": "Evidence of positive operating leverage (costs declining faster than revenue, margin expansion during growth)",
      "what_would_disconfirm": "Would disconfirm H1 (zero/negative operating leverage) if found SG&A% declining during revenue decline or expanding margins during revenue growth",
      "search_conducted": "Examined SG&A trends during revenue decline. Examined gross margin trends. Examined historical periods of revenue growth for evidence of margin expansion. Examined cost allocation changes.",
      "evidence_found": "NONE supporting positive leverage. SG&A 25.9% FLAT during 7% revenue decline (zero leverage proven). Cannot find historical evidence of margin expansion during growth periods. Gross margin declining (mix shift from Private Cloud 38.6% to Public Cloud 10.4% as Private Cloud declines faster). OPPOSITE found: negative leverage evident in Private Cloud (fixed infrastructure, declining revenue).",
      "interpretation": "Absence of positive leverage evidence across all time periods and segments confirms structural zero/negative leverage. If positive leverage existed, would appear SOMEWHERE (one segment, one time period, one cost category). Universal absence is DEFINITIVE."

    {
      "search_target": "Evidence of management control over margin drivers (ability to offset external pressures internally)",
      "what_would_disconfirm": "Would disconfirm H2 (external control of margins) if found operational improvements offsetting VMware shock, negotiating leverage with hyperscalers, or pricing power with customers",
      "search_conducted": "Examined management responses to VMware shock. Examined hyperscaler partnership negotiations. Examined pricing actions and customer response. Examined cost reduction programs.",
      "evidence_found": "NONE showing management control. VMware shock: no evidence of Broadcom negotiation success, no evidence of cost offset through internal efficiency. Hyperscaler partnerships: no long-term agreements, no evidence of leverage. Pricing power: email 706% increase triggered immediate exodus (definitive proof of ZERO pricing power). Management attempts (headcount cuts, CapEx reductions) create service degradation not margin improvement.",
      "interpretation": "Management has NO EFFECTIVE TOOLS to control margin trajectory. Dependent on external parties' decisions (Broadcom pricing, hyperscaler programs, customer retention). Cannot execute way to margin improvement—all levers either insufficient or counterproductive."

      "search_target": "Evidence of sustainable cost reductions without service degradation or future consequences",
      "what_would_disconfirm": "Would disconfirm H4 (backward-bending cost curves) if found cost reductions improving margins without triggering churn, service issues, or deferred problems",
      "search_conducted": "Examined headcount reduction outcomes. Examined CapEx reduction consequences. Examined customer satisfaction trends during cost reduction periods. Examined maintenance cost adequacy.",
      "evidence_found": "NONE showing sustainable reductions. Headcount cuts 12% vs revenue 7%: customer satisfaction declining (Stage 4: Trustpilot 'consistently worse'), burnout HIGH—indicates OVER-cutting with consequences. CapEx cuts 25%: underinvestment creating infrastructure aging, future cost spike deferred. Accounting adjustment (useful life extension) masks depreciation, does not eliminate need for asset replacement. ALL cost actions have NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES (service degradation, deferred costs, accelerated churn).",
      "interpretation": "NO cost reduction levers that genuinely improve economics without consequences. Every action trades short-term margin appearance for long-term revenue or future cost spike. BACKWARD-BENDING confirmed—cannot improve position through cost actions."
