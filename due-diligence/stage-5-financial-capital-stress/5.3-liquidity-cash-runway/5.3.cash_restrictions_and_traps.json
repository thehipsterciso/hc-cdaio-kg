TYPICAL STRUCTURE: 'No restricted payments except: (a) up to $X annually if Total Leverage Ratio < Y.Yx and no default exists, (b) up to $Z in aggregate if Interest Coverage Ratio > A.Ax, (c) unlimited if Total Leverage Ratio < B.Bx.' Exact thresholds UNKNOWN but standard ranges: Restricted payments basket $25-75M annually for company this size, Total Leverage Ratio threshold 4.0-5.0x, Interest Coverage Ratio threshold 2.0-2.5x.",
      "cash_impact": "If company is in COVENANT STRESS (Total Leverage Ratio near limit or Interest Coverage near minimum), restricted payments basket is ZERO or MINIMAL. Cannot move cash: (1) From borrower (Rackspace Finance LLC) to parent (Rackspace Technology Inc.), (2) From US entities to international subsidiaries for investment, (3) To Apollo as dividends (investor return blocked). INTERPRETATION: Cash generated at borrower entity is TRAPPED for debt service and operations only—cannot be deployed strategically. If parent entity needs cash (corporate overhead, public company costs), must rely on management fees from subsidiaries (subject to transfer pricing limits) or intercompany loans (creates new debt at subsidiary, increases leverage).",

Lenders can withhold consent or demand: (1) Debt paydown as condition of consent, (2) Covenant amendments (stricter terms), (3) Higher interest rates or fees, (4) Equity infusion from Apollo before allowing cash movement.",

Given operating loss structure (-6.4% operating margin before D&A), likely ZERO basket capacity. Apollo's equity investment is TRAPPED until debt refinanced or company sold.

Cannot raise new debt for: (1) Acquisition financing, (2) Dividend financing, (3) Working capital beyond permitted baskets, (4) Refinancing junior debt (would require lender consent).

Options: (1) Request incremental facility (lenders likely to decline if business deteriorating, or demand onerous pricing and terms), (2) Raise equity from Apollo (dilutes existing shareholders, signals distress to market, may violate NASDAQ listing requirements if public float too small), (3) Asset sales (discussed below). Lack of revolver (no ABL disclosed) means ZERO emergency liquidity facility. If cash depletes, NO BACKUP FINANCING available without lender consent and onerous terms.",

Asset sales also require lender consent if: (a) Assets sold exceed $X annually (typically $50-150M), (b) Assets are material to collateral base, (c) Sale is to affiliate or related party. Lenders have RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL or approval rights over material asset sales.",

EXAMPLE: If Government segment sold for $200M (assume net proceeds $180M after costs), and annual carve-out is $50M, must prepay $130M of debt. Cannot use $180M to fund operations or strategic initiatives. Remaining $1.17B debt service continues on reduced EBITDA base (Government EBITDA lost), potentially triggering covenant breach.",
