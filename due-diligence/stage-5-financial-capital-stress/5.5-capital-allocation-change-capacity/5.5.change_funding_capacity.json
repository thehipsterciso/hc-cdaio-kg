But defensive moves are MULTI-PRONGED—need to execute ALL SIMULTANEOUSLY to prevent death spiral. Email exit + data center consolidation + Government review = $20-75M combined, exceeds annual discretionary budget. FORCED to sequence (do Email exit in Year 1, data center consolidation in Year 2, Government review in Year 3), but sequencing allows problems to worsen while waiting for capital. Email segment may lose $10-30M in Year 1 while waiting for capital to execute exit in Year 2 (cumulative loss exceeds exit cost—should have exited immediately).
