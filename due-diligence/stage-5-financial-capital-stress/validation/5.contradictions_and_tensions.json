    "overall_assessment": "Financial model contains SEVEN material contradictions, THREE acute (forcing resolution within 6-18 months), FOUR chronic (creating ongoing dysfunction).

Multiple elements are mutually incompatible, creating forcing mechanisms that REQUIRE resolution within 6-18 months. Resolution pathways: (1) Voluntary turnaround (10-15% probability—requires Apollo support + lender cooperation, both absent), (2) Third-party intervention (30-40% probability—requires value perception despite distress), (3) Forced restructuring (40-50% probability—default mechanism when voluntary fails), (4) Liquidation (5-10% probability—if reorganization nonviable).",

HIGH PROBABILITY (80-90%) that at least ONE forcing mechanism triggers within 12-18 months, requiring resolution response.",
    "stakeholder_implications": "All stakeholders face binary outcomes: Either contradictions RESOLVED (requires dramatic action—capital injection, debt restructuring, strategic repositioning—outcomes uncertain but turnaround possible), OR contradictions PERSIST and force failure (bankruptcy reorganization, distressed sale, liquidation—stakeholder recoveries impaired). NO MIDDLE PATH—current trajectory is UNSUSTAINABLE, continuation without resolution leads inevitably to forcing event."
