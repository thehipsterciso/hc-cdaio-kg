    "overall_confidence_in_stage_5_conclusions": "HIGH (85-90%) for DIRECTIONAL conclusions, MODERATE (60-75%) for TIMING precision",
    "directional_confidence_explanation": "HIGH confidence (85-90%) that: (1) Financial model is contradictory and unsustainable (proven by mathematical contradictions, natural experiments, temporal sequences), (2) Revenue durability is failing (net leakage 21%, churn accelerating, bookings growth not translating to revenue), (3) Margin structure is locked in losses (gross margin 19.5% < SG&A 25.9% = operating losses unavoidable without fundamental change), (4) Liquidity is constrained with acute time pressure (cash burn $150-250M, runway measured in months not years), (5) Lender control transfer approaching (covenant breach within quarters, restrictions comprehensive, no cooperation observed), (6) Capital allocation is prisoner's dilemma deadlock (Apollo zero injection, lenders comprehensive restrictions, cooperation absent). DIRECTIONAL conclusions robust to uncertainties—even under optimistic assumptions on unknowns, contradictions persist and resolution forced.",
    "timing_precision_explanation": "MODERATE confidence (60-75%) in TIMING precision due to: (1) Covenant breach timing 6-15 months (2.5X range, depends on unknown covenant levels and cushion), (2) Liquidity runway 5-15 months (3X range, depends on burn volatility and accessible cash), (3) Accounting mechanism exhaustion 2-8 quarters (4X range, depends on management choices and auditor timing), (4) Forcing mechanism identification (which of five arrives first unpredictable). TIMING uncertainty does NOT undermine DIRECTIONAL conclusions—resolution is FORCED within 6-18 months (confidence HIGH), but WHETHER in month 6 vs month 12 vs month 18 is LOW PRECISION. Directional certainty with timing uncertainty is APPROPRIATE response to evidence—preserves intellectual honesty while enabling action.",
    "what_high_confidence_enables": "DIRECTIONAL conclusions enable: (1) Recognizing financial model is unsustainable (not 'turnaround in progress', not 'temporary difficulties'), (2) Understanding resolution is FORCED not optional (external intervention or failure within 6-18 months), (3) Identifying root causes (revenue durability failure, structural operating losses, capital constraints, stakeholder misalignment), (4) Mapping forcing mechanisms (liquidity, covenants, customer confidence, competition, suppliers), (5) Assessing pathway viability (capital solution depends on Apollo position unknown, lender cooperation currently absent). HIGH directional confidence is SUFFICIENT for understanding nature and severity of situation.",
    "what_uncertainty_preserves": "Acknowledging uncertainty zones preserves: (1) INTELLECTUAL HONESTY (do not claim precision where evidence incomplete), (2) INFORMATION PRIORITIES (Apollo position, lender syndicate, covenant details are HIGH VALUE to resolve for action planning), (3) SCENARIO RANGE (Apollo supporting = turnaround possible, Apollo exiting = failure probable—both possible, evidence insufficient to conclude), (4) DECISION QUALITY (recognizing what is KNOWN vs UNKNOWN enables appropriate action under uncertainty, prevents false confidence), (5) DISCOVERY DISCIPLINE (maintains Stage 0 mandate—discovery not strategy, cannot collapse uncertainty prematurely).",
    "confidence_calibration_check": "Confidence levels calibrated by: (1) DISCONFIRMING EVIDENCE SEARCHES conducted Stage 5.6—found ZERO contradictory evidence after comprehensive searches, strengthens confidence, (2) NATURAL EXPERIMENTS provide definitive evidence (Email price test FAILED, VMware cost shock absorption FORCED—both unambiguous), (3) MATHEMATICAL CONTRADICTIONS eliminate alternative explanations (bookings +14% + net leakage 21% + revenue -7% CANNOT coexist if bookings = quality growth—arithmetic proof), (4) TEMPORAL SEQUENCES establish causality (cost cuts → service degradation → churn acceleration observed chronologically with mechanism), (5) REVEALED PREFERENCES eliminate subjective interpretation (Apollo $0 injection, lender zero flexibility—actions reveal true positions regardless of narratives). Confidence is EVIDENCE-BASED not assumption-based.",
    "appropriate_use_of_ranges": "Wide ranges (cash burn $150-250M, VMware shock $100-210M, covenant breach 6-15 months) reflect HONEST UNCERTAINTY not imprecision failure. Ranges are APPROPRIATE when: (1) Multiple scenarios plausible with available evidence, (2) Missing information prevents precision (covenant definitions, internal forecasts), (3) Future dependent on uncertain events (working capital volatility, auditor timing, customer behavior). NARROW RANGES would be FALSE PRECISION given information limitations. PRESERVING RANGE WIDTH maintains intellectual honesty and prevents misleading certainty.",
    "when_precision_matters_vs_direction": "PRECISION matters for: Tactical timing (when to act), Resource mobilization (how much time to prepare), Forcing mechanism prediction (which arrives first determines response). DIRECTION matters for: Strategic assessment (is situation sustainable or not), Root cause identification (why is model contradictory), Pathway evaluation (what intervention types could work). CURRENT ANALYSIS: HIGH confidence in DIRECTION (unsustainable, contradictory, resolution forced), MODERATE confidence in PRECISION (timing 6-18 months but which month uncertain). This confidence distribution is APPROPRIATE—sufficient for strategic understanding, honest about tactical uncertainty.",
    "unknowns_that_would_change_conclusions": "VERY FEW unknowns would change DIRECTIONAL conclusions: (1) IF Apollo committed $200-500M capital with lender cooperation, turnaround pathway opens (currently CLOSED per zero injection and no cooperation)—changes FEASIBILITY not NEED. (2) IF Adjusted EBITDA is substantially negative (not positive as implied), covenant breach IMMINENT not 6-15 months—changes TIMING urgency not DIRECTION. (3) IF pricing power exists contrary to two natural experiment failures, margin improvement via pricing possible—BUT two direct tests FAILED definitively, pricing power evidence would need to be EXTRAORDINARY to overturn. MOST unknowns affect TIMING, MAGNITUDE, or MECHANISM—very few affect FUNDAMENTAL CONCLUSION (financial model contradictory, unsustainable, resolution forced).",
