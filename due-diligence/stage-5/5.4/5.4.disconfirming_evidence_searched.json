Searched exhaustively for: (1) Management autonomy or mechanical covenants (NONE found, corporate actions prove restrictions binding), (2) Thick covenant cushion (NONE found, non-disclosure and operating losses suggest stress), (3) Free cash movement or administrative-only multi-entity structure (NONE found, cash trapping explicitly documented), (4) Change of control carve-outs (NONE found, provision absolute and binding), (5) Low cross-default risk (NONE found, threshold low and triggers numerous). ABSENCE OF CONTRADICTORY EVIDENCE after comprehensive search STRENGTHENS control transfer conclusions. If lenders DIDN'T control or covenants WEREN'T restrictive, evidence would appear in: M&A activity, dividend payments, management autonomy statements, covenant comfort disclosures, cash mobility. ZERO such evidence found in 6 years post-IPO (2020-2026).",
    "methodology_note": "Falsification searches comprehensive across: Public disclosures (10-K, 10-Q, 8-K filings), earnings materials (Q4 2024), management commentary (investor presentations, earnings calls), corporate actions (M&A history, dividend payments), prior stage analyses (Stage 1, 5.2, 5.3), industry standards (credit agreement structures), distressed credit precedents. Negative evidence (absence of positive statements) is INFORMATIVE—companies disclose flexibility/comfort if exists, silence indicates constraints. Six-year behavioral pattern (zero M&A, zero dividends) is DEFINITIVE evidence of restrictions."
