IMPACT ON TIMELINE: If cushion <0.5x, breach in 2-4 quarters (6-12 months). If cushion >1.0x, breach in 4-8 quarters (12-24 months). 2X VARIANCE in control transfer timing. DIRECTIONAL CONCLUSION UNCHANGED (breach probable given trajectory) but URGENCY varies significantly.",

With these, can calculate PRECISE quarters to breach given current trajectory."

Have lenders challenged? (4) Current add-backs: Is Adjusted EBITDA materially higher than cash-based EBITDA (e.g., 20-30% inflated)? IMPACT: If EBITDA heavily adjusted WITH lender discretion, lenders can manufacture covenant breach by disallowing add-backs. If EBITDA minimally adjusted or mechanical, lender discretion limited. Determines whether control transfer is GRADUAL (lenders use discretion pre-breach) or EPISODIC (only formal breach transfers control).",

Reveals lender discretion leverage and pre-default control mechanisms."

IMPACT: If sweep is 75-100% at current leverage levels, ANY positive cash generation captured by lenders—prevents cash accumulation for growth, strategic investments, or equity returns. If sweep is 25-50%, partial cash retention possible. Determines whether turnaround scenario benefits EQUITY (partial retention) or ONLY LENDERS (full sweep).",

IMPACT: LOW threshold ($25M) with broad definition and short cure creates HIGH BRITTLENESS—many potential triggers exceed threshold. HIGH threshold ($75-100M) with carve-outs creates LOWER RISK—fewer failures reach threshold.

IMPACT: EXTENSIVE reporting with budget approval creates CONTINUOUS LENDER SUPERVISION—de facto operational oversight even without formal default. MINIMAL reporting (quarterly financials only) creates EPISODIC interaction—lenders less involved until breach.

How did lenders respond (supportive? extractive? aggressive?), (4) Amendment precedents: What fees/concessions did lenders demand in past modifications (if any)? IMPACT: SUPPORTIVE lenders with amendment history likely WAIVE breach with moderate fees (1-2%, 100-150bps rate increase). EXTRACTIVE lenders or first-time breach likely demand HEAVY CONCESSIONS (3% fees, 300bps rates, CRO appointment, equity warrants).

Even with maximum uncertainty (thick cushion, supportive lenders, mechanical covenants), trajectory leads to breach eventually—question is WHEN (2-8 quarters) and COST (moderate vs severe concessions). With minimum uncertainty (thin cushion, extractive lenders, discretionary covenants), breach is IMMINENT (1-3 quarters) and COSTLY (CRO appointment, heavy dilution). RANGE is wide but OUTCOME convergent."
