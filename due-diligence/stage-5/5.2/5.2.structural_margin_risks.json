Mix shift exacerbates: Private Cloud (38.6% margin) declining 13% YoY fastest while Public Cloud (10.4% margin) declining slower, creating unfavorable margin mix. To achieve 5% operating margin (minimum viability), requires EITHER: (1) Gross margin expansion from 19.5% to 30.9% (IMPOSSIBLE—Public Cloud commodity 10.4%, Private Cloud under VMware pressure), OR (2) SG&A reduction from 25.9% to 14.5% (requires 45% cut = $320M elimination, operationally impossible without destroying business).

STRUCTURAL because: locked to VMware by historical platform decisions (Stage 1.3 path dependencies), customer environments built on VMware cannot quickly change platforms, Broadcom has pricing power and no incentive to moderate (willing to lose Rackspace as customer to optimize VMware profit). Management has NO GOOD OPTION—all paths destroy value.",

If partner credits reduced from 10-15% to 5%, Public Cloud margin compresses from 10.4% to ~5% (UNPROFITABLE after SG&A allocation). STRUCTURAL because: cannot raise management fees to offset (customers defect to hyperscaler-direct), cannot switch hyperscalers (customers chose specific clouds), cannot reduce costs proportionally (delivery personnel semi-fixed).
