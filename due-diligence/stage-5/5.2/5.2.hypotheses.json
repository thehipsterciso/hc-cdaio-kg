      "notes": "SG&A remained FLAT at 25.9% during 7% revenue decline—definitively proves ZERO operating leverage. Headcount declined 12% vs revenue 7% appears positive but creates service degradation (satisfaction declining) indicating OVER-cutting beyond sustainable. Private Cloud fixed infrastructure demonstrates NEGATIVE leverage (depreciation fixed, revenue declining 13%). No disconfirming evidence found—no segment exhibits positive leverage. IMPLICATION: Business cannot improve margins through scale, cannot preserve margins during decline. Structurally trapped in negative/zero leverage regime."

Hyperscaler partner credits: 5-15% margin controlled by AWS/Azure/Google unilaterally. Email churn: 706% price increase rejected by customers (zero pricing power). Management has NO CONTROL over primary margin drivers—dependent on: Broadcom pricing restraint (not forthcoming), hyperscaler partnership maintenance (at-risk), customer price acceptance (proven absent). No disconfirming evidence found. IMPLICATION: Margin trajectory determined by third parties with misaligned incentives, not manageable through operational execution."

Customer satisfaction declining (Stage 4) indicates service degradation from underinvestment. Goodwill impairment $715M (2024) indicates acquisitions destroyed value. PATTERN: Management using accounting adjustments and deferred investment to mask margin compression short-term, creating FUTURE PROBLEMS (aging infrastructure failures, accelerated churn).

Headcount cuts 12% vs revenue 7%: satisfaction declining, burnout HIGH—over-cutting below service threshold will trigger churn acceleration 6-12 months forward (costs saved short-term, revenue lost long-term). CapEx underinvestment: deferred today, emergency costs or churn tomorrow. VMware shock: if passed through triggers churn, if absorbed destroys margin—NO GOOD OPTION (backward-bending). IMPLICATION: Management trapped in situations where ALL available actions worsen outcomes. Cannot cut costs without triggering churn, cannot raise prices without triggering churn, cannot maintain status quo (loses money). BACKWARD-BENDING cost curves eliminate viable management paths."

Consolidation = IMMEDIATE AUTHORIZATION LOSS (Government + UK Sovereign). SG&A 25.9% vs healthy MSP 15-18% = 8-11 point penalty ($220-300M annually). NO consolidation opportunities found—all fragmentation is REGULATORY not operational choice. Multi-entity structure is PERMANENT margin drag that cannot be eliminated without exiting regulated markets (Government + UK Sovereign = $400-550M revenue loss, accelerating overall decline). TRAPPED: Cannot consolidate, cannot exit without destroying remaining business."

Broadcom VMware shock is EXTERNAL EVENT not management decision. Multi-entity isolation is REGULATORY REQUIREMENT per Stage 1. All key findings based on FACTS not INFERENCE."
