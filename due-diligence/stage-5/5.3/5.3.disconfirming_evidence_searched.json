NOT A SINGLE PIECE OF CONTRADICTORY EVIDENCE emerged despite active search. This STRENGTHENS confidence in liquidity stress conclusions—if evidence existed that liquidity was adequate, backup existed, customers were loyal, or stress events avoided, it would have appeared in: earnings disclosures, management statements, corporate actions (dividends/M&A), or credit facility documentation. ABSENCE OF DISCONFIRMING EVIDENCE after systematic search is STRONG CONFIRMATION of liquidity crisis conclusions.",
