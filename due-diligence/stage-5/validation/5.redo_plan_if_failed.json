Continue until minimum 3 distinct failure modes documented with quantified impacts.",

      "why_critical": "Revenue durability failure modes identify how business loses customers and revenue—insufficient identification means missing threats, inadequate risk assessment, incomplete picture of financial reality."

      "failure_condition": "IF major claims lack specific evidence or source traceability (actual: all major claims traced to sources, evidence basis strong)",
      "would_require_redo": "Sub-stages with weak claim-evidence links",
      "remediation_required": "For each unsupported claim: (1) Provide specific quantified evidence, (2) Cite source documents, (3) Explain calculation methodology if derived, (4) Assign confidence level, (5) Identify assumptions if any. Remove claims that cannot be supported with evidence.",
      "estimated_timeline": "1-2 weeks per sub-stage requiring remediation",
      "why_critical": "Claims without evidence are assertions not findings—undermine credibility, prevent verification, enable narrative-driven analysis instead of discovery-focused analysis. Gate must enforce evidence discipline."

      "failure_condition": "IF no falsification attempts conducted or disconfirming evidence not searched (actual: 5 systematic falsification searches conducted, zero disconfirming evidence found, Grade A)",
      "would_require_redo": "All sub-stages with major conclusions",
      "remediation_required": "For each major conclusion: (1) Formulate as testable hypothesis, (2) Design falsification search (what evidence would disprove?), (3) Conduct search systematically, (4) Report findings honestly (if disconfirming evidence found, adjust conclusion or explain why doesn't invalidate), (5) Document search methodology and results. Minimum 3-5 falsification searches required for Stage 5 scope.",
      "estimated_timeline": "2-4 weeks (falsification searches time-consuming)",
      "why_critical": "Falsification attempts are CORE scientific method requirement—without them, analysis is confirmation-biased narrative construction. Stage 0 constitutional mandate requires falsification discipline. Gate must enforce this strictly—no falsification attempts = automatic FAIL regardless of other qualities."

      "remediation_required": "For each false precision claim: (1) Identify information gaps preventing precision, (2) Expand point estimate to honest range reflecting uncertainty, (3) Document what information would reduce uncertainty, (4) Explain impact of uncertainty on decisions, (5) Lower confidence level if precision claimed exceeded evidence. Create comprehensive uncertainty register documenting critical unknowns.",
      "estimated_timeline": "1-2 weeks (expanding ranges and documenting uncertainty)",
      "why_critical": "False precision destroys decision quality—users make tactical plans based on misleading precision, surprised when reality differs. Intellectual honesty requires acknowledging uncertainty—honest ranges > false points. Gate must enforce uncertainty preservation—collapsing uncertainty is MISREPRESENTATION."

Reframe as DISCOVERY: 'Evidence shows X, if Y occurs then Z follows, pathways exist but outcomes uncertain.' Maintain observer stance, avoid prescriptive voice.",
      "estimated_timeline": "1 week (reframing content)",
      "why_critical": "Stage 0 constitutional constraint—DISCOVERY ONLY, no strategy/valuation/recommendations. Prevents work from being misused (discovery findings presented as strategic recommendations create liability, misrepresent scope, violate discovery mandate).

  "gate_enforcement_principles": {
    "principle_1": "Gate is MEANINGFUL—can and should FAIL analyses that do not meet standards. Not rubber stamp, not formality. FAIL condition possible and appropriate if quality insufficient.",
    "principle_2": "Exit criteria are ABSOLUTE—must meet ALL FIVE, not optional. Meeting 4 of 5 = FAIL, requires remediation of failing criterion before progression.",
    "principle_3": "QA checks are MANDATORY—hypothesis discipline, uncertainty preservation, claim integrity are CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENTS (Stage 0). Failure on any = FAIL gate regardless of exit criteria met.",
    "principle_4": "Redo plan must be SPECIFIC—identify exactly which sub-stages require work, what remediation needed, estimated timeline. Vague 'redo everything' unacceptable—precise surgical remediation required.",
    "principle_5": "Progression PROHIBITED if failed—Stage 6 work cannot begin until Stage 5 PASSES. Prevents cascading quality degradation (weak Stage 5 → weak Stage 6 → entire analysis compromised)."
