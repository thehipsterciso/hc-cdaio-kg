ABSENCE OF CONTRADICTORY EVIDENCE after comprehensive search STRENGTHENS capital constraint conclusions. If capital were adequate or constraints manageable, evidence would appear in: Initiative successes, growing investment, covenant relief, Apollo support, external capital inflows, operational improvements. ZERO such evidence found across 6 years post-IPO (2020-2026) and 1 year post-refinancing (March 2024-present).",
    "methodology_note": "Falsification searches comprehensive across: Public disclosures (10-K, 10-Q, 8-K filings, earnings materials), management commentary (investor presentations, earnings calls), financial trends (CapEx, headcount, operating metrics), capital markets activity (equity, debt, M&A), Apollo portfolio behavior (equity injections, support patterns). Negative evidence (absence of positive developments) is INFORMATIVE—companies and PE owners publicize successes, capital injections, flexibility gains if they occur. Silence combined with deteriorating metrics indicates ABSENCE not non-disclosure. Six-year pattern of declining investment, shrinking capital, no initiative successes is DEFINITIVE evidence capital constraint is binding and worsening.",
    "apollo_non_support_significance": "Apollo's failure to inject capital despite 53-57% control stake and multi-year deterioration is MOST SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE DATA POINT. Apollo is sophisticated PE firm with: (1) Deep pockets (AUM $733B per public disclosures), (2) Control stake (can direct strategy, has information access), (3) Trapped investment (cannot exit due to change of control provision per Stage 5.4), (4) Multi-year runway to observe problems (IPO March 2020, 6 years of declining metrics). YET: Zero equity injection disclosed. INTERPRETATION: Apollo internal analysis concludes: Additional capital does not generate sufficient returns to justify deployment, OR business trajectory unfixable even with capital, OR Apollo unwilling to increase exposure to deteriorating asset. ALL interpretations are maximally negative for independent assessment—if sophisticated insider with control and information access is not supporting, external parties should view skeptically."
