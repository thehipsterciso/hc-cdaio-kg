ABSENCE OF CONTRADICTORY EVIDENCE after comprehensive search STRENGTHENS financial contradiction conclusions.

Negative evidence (absence of improvements where expected if contradictions false) is INFORMATIVE. If cost cuts truly improved efficiency, customer satisfaction would IMPROVE (observable).

These two failures ALONE are sufficient to conclude zero pricing power—no additional evidence needed. Yet SUPPORTING evidence extensive (thin margins 10-12%, low switching costs, commodity positioning). Convergence of natural experiment failures + structural indicators = VERY HIGH CONFIDENCE (95%+) pricing power is absent.",

If ANY of the following were true: (1) Turnaround was feasible with capital injection, (2) Lenders were cooperative and would support turnaround investment, (3) Management had credible plan executable with capital, Apollo WOULD inject to protect existing $X billion investment and potentially create 3-10X return from successful turnaround. Apollo is SOPHISTICATED PE firm with deep resources, information access (board seats, management reporting), and expertise in distressed turnarounds. Apollo's REVEALED PREFERENCE (zero injection despite conditions favoring intervention) is strongest signal that: Turnaround economics are unfavorable OR Lender cooperation unavailable OR Management/business unable to execute OR All three. EXTERNAL OBSERVER cannot distinguish which reason, but ALL are negative. Apollo non-action is DEFINITIVE evidence turnaround under current constraints is not viable—if Apollo with control, information, resources, and expertise won't support, external parties should assume turnaround unlikely without fundamentally different structure."
