  "stage": "1",

  "gate_rationale": "All 5 exit criteria met. Stage 1 successfully maps legal-operational reality of Rackspace Technology, identifying 10+ structurally relevant entities, 5+ control/veto points, 6+ historical path dependencies, multiple contracts materially blocking change, and 10+ false flexibility assumptions invalidated. Entity structure, ownership reality, historical constraints, contractual architecture, and jurisdictional lock-ins are documented with evidence lineage, touch tests applied, and uncertainty preserved. Stage 1 establishes that Rackspace operates as portfolio of jurisdictionally-segregated businesses under multi-layered contractual veto structure with permanent path dependencies from 2016-2024 decisions. No material gaps or failures identified. Stage 1 is COMPLETE and LITIGATION-SURVIVABLE."
