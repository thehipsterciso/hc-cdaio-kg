      "description": "Public shareholders hold ~43-47% of economic value (~$52-56M at current $120M market cap) but exercise ZERO meaningful control over corporate actions. Cannot elect directors (Apollo controls board elections via majority vote). Cannot block mergers, asset sales, or going-private transactions requiring simple majority. Cannot force strategic changes or M&A processes. Cannot influence financing decisions (board/creditor authority). Economic entitlement exists without governance participation.",
      "risk_manifestation": "Apollo can execute transactions favoring Apollo's interests at expense of public shareholders: (1) Going-private transaction at low valuation (current $0.48 price creates cheap buyout opportunity for Apollo), (2) Asset stripping or dividend recaps benefiting Apollo disproportionately, (3) Related-party transactions with Apollo affiliates at non-arm's length terms, (4) Strategic decisions prioritizing Apollo's exit timing over long-term value creation. Public shareholders' only recourse is appraisal rights (costly, uncertain) or litigation (faces business judgment rule deference). Market price of $0.48 may reflect PUBLIC SHAREHOLDER DISCOUNT for lack of control.",
      "decision_impact": "MATERIAL: Any transaction requiring public shareholder participation (e.g., tender offer, merger requiring supermajority) must account for public shareholder distrust and potential appraisal/litigation risk. Acquirer would inherit this misalignment if buying less than 100%. Going-private transaction to eliminate public shareholders requires fairness opinion, special committee review, and appraisal rights - adding cost and time.",

      "description": "Apollo holds 53-57% economic stake (~$64-68M at current market cap) but exercises ABSOLUTE CONTROL over governance and operations via majority vote and board representation. Apollo's economic exposure is MODEST relative to: (1) $1.3B debt obligation (Apollo equity is <6% of enterprise value), (2) Potential litigation judgments or ransomware liabilities, (3) Customer concentration or revenue volatility risks. Apollo has ASYMMETRIC UPSIDE (can force sale or take-private at opportune time) but LIMITED DOWNSIDE (equity cushion behind $1.3B debt means creditors absorb first loss). Apollo's control allows it to optimize for its 53-57% stake rather than total enterprise value.",
      "risk_manifestation": "Apollo's decisions may prioritize: (1) Quick exit over long-term investment (PE fund lifecycle creates exit pressure), (2) Cash extraction via dividends/recaps (subject to debt covenants) over reinvestment, (3) Cost-cutting to boost EBITDA for sale even if strategically suboptimal, (4) Risk-taking beyond prudent levels (equity behind debt = creditors bear downside). If enterprise value declines, creditors suffer first (debt impairment) while Apollo retains control. This creates MORAL HAZARD - Apollo controls decisions but creditors bear substantial economic risk.",
      "decision_impact": "CRITICAL: Creditor-equity misalignment is ACUTE given stressed stock price ($0.48) and substantial debt ($1.3B). Creditors' interests diverge from Apollo's: Creditors want value preservation and debt repayment; Apollo may prioritize exit optionality or equity value recovery even if risky. Any transaction must address this misalignment - creditor consent required for major actions per negative covenants. Acquirer must assess whether Apollo's historical decisions were value-maximizing or Apollo-optimizing.",

Lenders have DOWNSIDE EXPOSURE (default risk, credit deterioration) but NO EQUITY UPSIDE (fixed interest rate of Term SOFR + 2.75%, no warrants or conversion rights disclosed). Lenders can BLOCK value-creating transactions if those transactions increase credit risk even marginally. Lenders optimize for CREDIT PRESERVATION, not enterprise value maximization.",
      "risk_manifestation": "Lenders may block transactions that would benefit equity holders but modestly increase leverage or operational risk: (1) Growth acquisitions requiring additional debt (even if value-accretive), (2) Product pivots or market expansion requiring capex (even if strategically sound), (3) Asset sales to raise liquidity if reduces collateral base, (4) Management changes or operational initiatives perceived as risky. Lenders have FIRST PRIORITY CLAIM on assets - creates conservatism bias. Apollo's interests (maximize equity value) conflict with lenders' interests (minimize default risk). Tension between equity and creditors is HIGHEST when enterprise struggles (current low stock price suggests stress).",
      "decision_impact": "CRITICAL: Lender consent is REQUIRED for most transactions affecting capital structure, asset base, or ownership. Lender conservatism may prevent value-maximizing actions. Acquirer must negotiate with lenders (not just Apollo) to complete transaction. Lenders may extract concessions (paydown, pricing adjustments, additional collateral) as condition of consent. If lenders refuse consent, transaction is BLOCKED regardless of Apollo's wishes. Creditor-equity tensions could force debt refinancing as precondition to M&A.",

However, management's ECONOMIC STAKE (equity compensation via RSUs/options) is likely MODEST relative to Apollo's 53-57% or even public shareholders' 43-47%. Management's primary economic interest is EMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION (salary, bonus, benefits) not equity value maximization. Management optimizes for: (1) Job security and career progression, (2) Short-term performance metrics tied to annual bonus, (3) Avoiding blame for operational failures.",

Management has INFORMATIONAL ADVANTAGE and can slow-walk or obstruct board directives through: (1) Selective disclosure emphasizing downside risks, (2) Implementation delays claiming operational constraints, (3) Pessimistic projections to discourage bold actions. Principal-agent problem is ACUTE: Management controls execution but Apollo/public shareholders bear economic risk.",
      "decision_impact": "MATERIAL: Acquirer must assess management quality, retention risk, and alignment. If management is entrenched and not aligned with shareholders, post-close integration will face resistance. Management change-of-control severance packages (golden parachutes) create COST of management replacement. Key person risk: If critical executives hold irreplaceable customer/operational relationships, their departure could impair value.

Fragmented control creates TRANSACTION FRICTION - any M&A, financing, or strategic change requires negotiating across multiple constituencies with divergent interests. Decision velocity slows. Lowest common denominator solutions emerge rather than optimal actions.",
      "decision_impact": "CRITICAL: Fragmented control means acquirer cannot assume clean decision-making post-close. Must obtain: (1) Apollo consent (via majority vote or board approval), (2) Lender consent (via credit agreement amendment or refinancing), (3) Management cooperation (via retention agreements or change-of-control severance), (4) Public shareholder tender or merger approval (subject to appraisal rights). Any ONE party refusing consent can derail transaction. Complexity and cost of achieving multi-party alignment is HIGH.
