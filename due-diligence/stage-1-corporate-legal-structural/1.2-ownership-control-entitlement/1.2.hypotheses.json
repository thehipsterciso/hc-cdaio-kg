DISCONFIRMING EVIDENCE FOUND: (1) First Lien Lenders have VETO POWER via negative covenants over M&A, asset sales, dividends, additional debt - Apollo CANNOT act without lender consent on material transactions. (2) Change-of-control provisions require lender consent or debt repayment - Apollo CANNOT sell company without addressing $1.3B debt. (3) Public shareholders have appraisal rights creating cost/delay for going-private. (4) NASDAQ delisting risk (stock <$1.00) creates external constraint. (5) Management has operational control and can obstruct Apollo directives. CONCLUSION: Control is CONCENTRATED in Apollo for governance decisions (board, management appointments) but CONSTRAINED by creditors for capital structure decisions. Apollo's control is INCOMPLETE - must negotiate with lenders for material transactions. Hypothesis WEAKENED."

(2) Public shareholders 43-47% economic stake but ZERO meaningful control (cannot elect directors, cannot block actions). (3) Management has OPERATIONAL control but likely <5% equity stake (prioritizes employment over shareholder value). (4) Lenders have $1.3B exposure and VETO POWER but NO equity upside (fixed interest, no warrants). (5) Apollo's $64-68M exposure is <6% of enterprise value ($1.3B debt + $120M equity) yet Apollo controls strategy. DISCONFIRMING EVIDENCE SOUGHT BUT NOT FOUND: No evidence of one-share-one-vote alignment. No management equity stakes disclosed suggesting >25% ownership. No lender equity kickers. CONCLUSION: Misalignment is PERVASIVE. Apollo controls with modest economic exposure. Public shareholders have economic stake without control. Creditors have veto power without upside. Management controls operations without significant equity. Hypothesis STRONGLY SUPPORTED."

(3) No shareholder rights plan (poison pill) disclosed in recent SEC filings or press releases. (4) Credit agreement negative covenants are DISCLOSED and substantial but not 'hidden' - they are publicly described in press release and Form 8-K. (5) No evidence of strategic partner veto rights. (6) H3 in Stage 1.1 found NO structural regulatory licenses requiring government approval for ownership changes. SUPPORTING EVIDENCE (LIMITED): Creditor veto rights exist but are DISCLOSED, not hidden. NASDAQ listing creates constraint but is regulatory, not stakeholder-specific. CONCLUSION: No HIDDEN veto rights identified. Creditor constraints are substantial but KNOWN. Apollo's control is constrained by disclosed creditor covenants, not by hidden minority protections.

(2) Management knows Apollo can replace them via majority shareholder vote - creates DEFERENCE even without explicit direction. (3) Apollo's reputation as PE sponsor creates market signaling - employees, customers, suppliers interpret actions through lens of 'Apollo is in control.' (4) NASDAQ delisting risk ($0.48 stock) creates EXTERNAL PRESSURE forcing company to consider reverse split or go-private (actions benefiting Apollo's exit options). (5) Management's operational control creates INFORMATION ASYMMETRY and ability to shape board's understanding of strategic options. DISCONFIRMING EVIDENCE SOUGHT BUT NOT FOUND: No evidence suggesting management acts independently of Apollo's interests. No evidence of robust independent director oversight checking Apollo influence. CONCLUSION: Formal control (majority vote, board seats) is AMPLIFIED by informal mechanisms (information control, reputation effects, implicit influence). Control reality exceeds formal governance. Hypothesis SUPPORTED."
