(2) Credit agreement explicitly references 'New Borrower' (Rackspace Finance LLC), 'New Holdings' (Rackspace Finance Holdings LLC), and 'Subsidiary Guarantors' (plural). (3) Employment agreements, indentures, and litigation name different Rackspace entities. (4) Subsidiary lists found in multiple sources (TrustArc PDF, search results referencing Exhibit 21). DISCONFIRMING EVIDENCE SOUGHT BUT NOT FOUND: No evidence of single-entity structure. Financial statements (not directly accessed but inferred from debt structure) must consolidate multiple entities. CONCLUSION: Multi-tiered structure confirmed. Complexity level: MODERATE (7+ material entities, 2-3 jurisdictional layers, debt isolated in separate vehicle)."

(3) Negative covenants confirmed: restrictions on debt incurrence, dividends/restricted payments, asset sales, liens, and mergers/consolidations. (4) Change-of-control provisions: mandatory offer to repurchase or lender consent required. (5) Make-whole premium on prepayments until Sep 12, 2025. DISCONFIRMING EVIDENCE SOUGHT BUT NOT FOUND: No evidence of covenant-lite structure. No evidence of unencumbered balance sheet (debt explicitly disclosed at $1.3B). CONCLUSION: Debt covenants materially constrain corporate actions. Springing covenant creates risk if revolving facility is drawn. Change-of-control provisions are HARD CONSTRAINT on M&A."

These are earned through audits and can be re-certified by any entity willing to undergo audit process. (4) No evidence of regulatory agency oversight (FCC, state banking boards, healthcare regulators) that would create change-of-control approval requirements. SUPPORTING EVIDENCE (LIMITED): (1) FedRAMP authorization is government-issued but is an authorization to serve government customers, not a license required to operate. (2) Compliance certifications create OPERATIONAL constraints (recertification required if entities change) but not REGULATORY constraints (no government approval required for ownership changes). CONCLUSION: Hypothesis WEAKENED. Company operates in substantially unregulated industry from structural perspective. Compliance requirements are contractual/customer-driven, not regulatory. No evidence of change-of-control regulatory approvals required."

Claims infringe three foundational FCoE patents (U.S. Patents 11,108,591; 11,310,077; 11,303,473). Patents relate to core networking technology potentially used in service offerings. (2) 2022 ransomware attack generated multiple class action lawsuits. Most resolved via arbitration (judge granted motion to compel arbitration) or confidential settlement, but one class action remains pending. (3) Ransomware response costs: $10.8 million disclosed, 30,000 customers affected, Hosted Exchange product discontinued. WEAKENING EVIDENCE: (1) Most ransomware litigation resolved - only one class action remains. (2) No regulatory investigations disclosed (SEC, DOJ, FTC). (3) Patent lawsuit recently filed (June 2024) - no judgment yet, damages unknown. (4) No securities litigation or derivative suits identified. CONCLUSION: Hypothesis SUPPORTED but LIMITED. Material litigation exists (patent case, remaining ransomware class action) but exposure magnitude is UNKNOWN. Patent case could be material if technology is core to offerings. Ransomware litigation largely resolved. No regulatory enforcement actions identified."

(2) Board includes Apollo affiliates: Aaron Sobel (Principal, Apollo since 2011) and Vikram Mahidhar (Operating Partner, Apollo since 2021). (3) Former Apollo partner David Sambur served as Chairman until January 2025 (9 years). (4) Apollo led 2016 take-private transaction ($4.3B), took company public in 2020 IPO, maintained majority stake post-IPO. (5) Company returned to public markets but operates as PE-controlled public company (unusual structure). DISCONFIRMING EVIDENCE SOUGHT BUT NOT FOUND: No evidence of dispersed ownership. No evidence of independent board majority (Apollo has 2 of ~7-9 board seats inferred, plus Chairman until Jan 2025). CONCLUSION: Hypothesis STRONGLY SUPPORTED. Apollo has absolute control via majority equity stake. Board representation provides governance participation and information rights. Principal-agent conflict exists: Apollo's interests (financial return, exit optionality) may diverge from minority public shareholders or other stakeholders. Market cap of ~$120M on $0.48 stock price suggests market views Apollo control as value-destructive or is pricing in poor fundamentals."
