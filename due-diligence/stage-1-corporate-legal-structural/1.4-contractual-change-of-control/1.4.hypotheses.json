(2) AWS Strategic Collaboration Agreement (Oct 2024) creates vendor concentration with 2,000+ customers, 1,000+ staff - AWS termination upon competitive acquisition would destroy 30-40% of revenue (inferred). (3) FedRAMP authorization is entity-specific requiring 12-18 month re-authorization per FedRAMP guidelines - government customers lost during gap. (4) Industry-standard MSP contracts include change-of-control provisions per TechContracts, Scott & Scott LLP research. (5) SOC 2, HIPAA/HITRUST certifications are entity-specific requiring recertification per standard audit frameworks. DISCONFIRMING EVIDENCE SOUGHT: No evidence found of transferable customer contracts or vendor partnerships permitting competitive acquisition. No evidence of MSP acquisitions closing without customer churn and consent requirements. PARTIAL DISCONFIRM: Financing constraint (lender veto) is EQUAL OR GREATER than contractual constraints - both are binding. However, even if debt refinanced, contractual constraints remain. CONCLUSION: Contractual constraints are CO-PRIMARY with financing constraints. Both independently sufficient to block transaction. Combined effect creates nearly insurmountable transaction barrier. Hypothesis SUPPORTED with caveat that financing is equally constraining."

(2) 2,000+ AWS customers, 1,000+ AWS-dedicated professionals, 250% growth indicates AWS is largest practice (likely 30-40% revenue concentration inferred). (3) Multicloud MSP positioning REQUIRES AWS, Microsoft, AND Google partnerships - termination of any destroys value proposition. (4) Change-of-control provisions in technology partnership agreements are industry standard per TechTarget research. (5) Competitive acquisition (Microsoft buying Rackspace) would rationally trigger AWS termination to prevent competitor benefit from partnership. DISCONFIRMING EVIDENCE SOUGHT: No evidence that partnerships are freely terminable or non-exclusive. No revenue breakdown by cloud provider publicly disclosed (listed as unknown in Stage 1.2). No evidence of cloud providers permitting partner acquisition by competitors. INFERENCE: If Rackspace lost AWS partnership, 2,000 customers and 1,000 staff become stranded - customers could go direct to AWS bypassing Rackspace. Revenue loss would exceed customer count suggests ($300-600M if AWS is 30-40% of revenue). CONCLUSION: Cloud providers have DE FACTO veto power via partnership termination threat. Limits buyer universe to financial sponsors and non-cloud strategics. Hypothesis STRONGLY SUPPORTED."

(2) MSP services run on commodity cloud infrastructure (AWS, Azure, GCP) - customers can migrate to direct cloud relationships or competitor MSPs within 30-90 days. (3) No evidence of proprietary Rackspace technology creating lock-in (Rackspace is services wrapper around AWS/Microsoft/Google infrastructure). (4) Change-of-control termination rights (industry standard) combined with data portability means customers can exit cleanly upon acquisition announcement. (5) 2022 ransomware attack forced 30,000 Hosted Exchange customers to migrate to alternatives - demonstrates customers CAN and WILL migrate when prompted. DISCONFIRMING EVIDENCE SOUGHT: No evidence of customer data lock-in or proprietary formats. No evidence of multi-year contracts without termination rights. Rackspace provides managed services not proprietary technology - inherently low switching costs. CONCLUSION: MSP business model has STRUCTURAL LOW DEFENSIBILITY. Customers can exit upon ownership change with minimal friction. Acquisition triggers prompt customers to reevaluate 'why use managed service provider vs go direct to cloud provider' - many will choose direct relationship. Churn of 10-30% is CONSERVATIVE estimate, could be higher. Hypothesis STRONGLY SUPPORTED - this is FUNDAMENTAL characteristic of MSP business model, not Rackspace-specific."
