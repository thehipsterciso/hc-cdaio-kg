      "current_constraint": "Inception entities persist in corporate structure with no apparent operating purpose (identified in Stage 1.1 as subsidiaries). These entities may hold tax attributes (NOLs, basis step-ups) from acquisition creating IRC Section 382 constraints on their removal. Apollo's 53-57% control structure stems from this transaction - created path dependency where company returned to public markets in 2020 but Apollo retained majority (unusual for PE exit). Debt structure traces lineage to 2016 LBO debt even after 2024 refinancing - constrains capital structure flexibility.",
      "why_it_persists": "Inception entities likely hold tax attributes that would be lost if dissolved (unknowable without tax diligence). Apollo retained majority stake post-IPO rather than full exit - likely due to: (1) Poor market conditions in 2020 preventing full exit, (2) Apollo's judgment that business had upside potential, (3) Desire to maintain control while accessing public markets for liquidity/currency. Debt structure persists because refinancing in 2024 restructured but did not eliminate leverage - company could not raise equity to pay down debt given low valuation.",

Dual constituency: public shareholders and Apollo with divergent interests and timelines.",

This structure was intended as 'temporary' to provide Apollo partial liquidity while maintaining control, but has persisted 5+ years creating ongoing governance complexity.",
      "why_it_persists": "Apollo chose NOT to fully exit via IPO, likely because: (1) Business valuation was depressed (stock fell 22% on IPO day, signaling weak demand), (2) Apollo believed in turnaround potential and wanted to capture future upside, (3) IPO provided some liquidity ($703M) while maintaining control for future exit optionality. Structure persists because: (1) Apollo has not found suitable buyer for majority stake, (2) Going-private would require buying out public shareholders at premium (expensive given Apollo's basis), (3) Stock price collapse (now $0.48 from $21 IPO) makes Apollo's stake illiquid.

Security infrastructure investments required across remaining products.",

Infrastructure/employees allocated to discontinued product must be: (1) Redeployed to other products (requires retraining, may not be feasible), (2) Divested or shut down (creates exit costs), (3) Left stranded (ongoing cost burden). Customer churn beyond Hosted Exchange - security-conscious customers may have fled to competitors questioning Rackspace's security posture. Litigation risk persists with remaining class action - contingent liability unknown. Insurance premiums likely increased post-incident. Capital must be allocated to security improvements rather than growth.",
      "why_it_persists": "Product discontinuation was IRREVERSIBLE decision - rebuilding Hosted Exchange would require: (1) Re-architecting entire environment, (2) Regaining customer trust after breach, (3) Competing with established players (Microsoft 365, Google Workspace), (4) Justifying investment in commodity product with low margins. Management determined ROI did not justify rebuild. Stranded assets persist because: (1) Infrastructure redeployment requires capex, (2) Employee retraining/redeployment is costly, (3) 2023 layoffs (4% workforce) suggest company chose to exit employees rather than redeploy.

Remaining employees have higher workloads, burnout risk, and are flight risks to better-funded competitors. Knowledge loss from departures means certain capabilities may be unrecoverable without rehiring. Offshoring creates time zone, cultural, and quality challenges. Morale damage from repeated layoffs (2021, 2023) creates 'survivor syndrome' reducing productivity.",
      "why_it_persists": "Layoffs were COST-REDUCTION driven, not WORK-ELIMINATION driven - revenue decline did not match headcount reduction, creating understaffing. Company could not afford workforce at prior levels given: (1) Stock price collapse destroying equity financing option, (2) Debt covenants preventing dividend/equity issuance to fund operations, (3) Revenue pressure from competition and ransomware incident.
