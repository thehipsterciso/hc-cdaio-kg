IMPLICIT THRESHOLD PRIOR: Tolerated indefinitely while aggregate corporate margins positive—segment-level losses masked in corporate aggregate allowing prolonged tolerance. Tolerance duration: Months-to-years per deal (CRM entry to profitability discovery lag), quarters-to-years enterprise-wide (margin erosion trending negative before intervention).",
      "who_accepts_the_risk": "RISK DISTRIBUTED: Sales benefits from CRM optimism through compensation (bookings-based incentive Stage 4.4), externalizes margin risk to delivery and finance. Delivery discovers cost reality post-signature, absorbs margin erosion through under-resourcing or losses (authority over delivery execution, no authority over deal acceptance Stage 4.1). Finance absorbs aggregate margin deterioration, manages investor expectations through conservative external adjustment (but adjustment insufficient to prevent -13%/-3% segment performance). CEO ultimately forced to intervene reactively when erosion severe (walk away policy, sales refresh Q3 2024). Customers indirectly absorb risk through service quality degradation when deals under-resourced to preserve margin.",
      "business_or_regulatory_consequence": "BUSINESS CONSEQUENCES MATERIAL: Revenue rejection (walk away policy rejects unprofitable deals/renewals reducing revenue), sales force instability (Q3 2024 refresh, talent turnover Stage 4.5), resource misallocation (hiring and capacity planning based on inflated pipeline value), margin compression threatening debt covenants ($1.3B debt Stage 5, negative cash flow from operations Q2 2024).

(2) Sales compensation—if opportunities rejected at entry for profitability, bookings volume declines threatening quota achievement, sales turnover accelerates. (3) Pipeline optics—CRM pipeline value declines materially if only profitable opportunities entered, investor/Board perception of growth potential damaged. (4) Delivery bandwidth—profitability validation requires delivery participation in pre-sales, diverts delivery resources from execution to estimation creating delivery bottleneck. (5) Deal flexibility—profitability validation at entry assumes static requirements, but customer scope changes post-signature common, pre-validation effort wasted.
