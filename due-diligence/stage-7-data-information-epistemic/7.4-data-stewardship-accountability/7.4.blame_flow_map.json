Finance has authority to change aggregation methodology (disaggregate metrics by jurisdiction, disclose variance, caveat fungibility assumptions), but finance lacks incentive—disaggregation complicates investor communications (operational complexity visible, 5-6x coordination multiplier exposed Stage 4.3), challenges enterprise integration narrative desirable for investor confidence, may prompt investor questions finance prefers to avoid. Operations has authority to demand disaggregated reporting (operations needs jurisdiction-specific visibility for operational planning), but operations lacks power—finance controls external reporting, operations internal consumer of finance-produced metrics, operations can escalate disagreement to CEO but CEO resolution political not methodology-based (Stage 7.3 selective enforcement cross-functional disputes). CEO has authority to mandate disaggregation or variance disclosure, but CEO hasn't exercised—aggregation simplicity tolerated, CEO may share finance incentive (investor narrative simplicity) over operations need (variance visibility for operational planning).",

When aggregation-driven misallocation causes execution failure: Finance not blamed—aggregation methodology not questioned, enterprise metrics accepted as accurate investor communication even if operationally misleading. Operations blamed for 'execution gap' or 'operational inefficiency'—customer deployment fails because jurisdiction capacity unavailable despite enterprise aggregate suggesting capacity exists, operations blamed for deployment failure not finance for aggregation variance erasure obscuring constraint. Delivery blamed for 'architectural limitations' when jurisdiction isolation prevents workload mobility—delivery designed jurisdiction-isolated architecture for regulatory compliance (FedRAMP, HIPAA Stage 6), but isolation framed as delivery constraint not compliance necessity when aggregation creates false fungibility expectation. Blame misallocation enables: Finance continues aggregation simplicity (investor communications ease prioritized over operational accuracy), operations accepts execution risk from misallocation (no authority to change upstream aggregation causing downstream misallocation), variance erasure perpetuated (aggregation methodology unchanged, variance invisible, misallocation recurs).",
      "organizational_risk": "BLAME MISALLOCATION PREVENTS AGGREGATION METHODOLOGY CORRECTION. Capital misallocation—investment decisions based on enterprise aggregates expand wrong jurisdiction (low-utilization jurisdiction expanded while high-utilization jurisdiction remains constrained because aggregate utilization suggested uniform excess capacity), ROI negative (expansion doesn't relieve constraints, capacity remains isolated and under-utilized). Customer commitment failures—sales makes capacity availability promises based on enterprise aggregates, delivery cannot fulfill because jurisdiction-specific capacity unavailable, customer experiences deployment delays or failures, SLA breach risk, customer dissatisfaction from unmet commitments. M&A integration complexity underestimated—acquirer assumes enterprise aggregates represent integrated fungible operations, discovers jurisdiction isolation post-close (regulatory constraints prevent integration, vendor contracts jurisdiction-specific Stage 6, technical architecture isolated), acquirer integration planning based on false assumptions requires redesign, integration costs/timeline increase. Competitive disadvantage—competitors with jurisdiction-specific operational visibility can target capacity/performance/price more accurately than Rackspace aggregate-based planning, competitors avoid misallocation Rackspace experiences. Investor communications risk—if aggregation methodology later questioned (diligence discovers variance, auditor questions aggregation for specific disclosure, regulator questions metrics if material to compliance scope), finance must defend or revise methodology, historical metrics comparability challenged, investor confidence in operational reporting damaged.",
      "touch_test_what_breaks_if_accountability_enforced": "ENFORCING ACCOUNTABILITY = REQUIRE FINANCE TO DISAGGREGATE JURISDICTIONS IN INVESTOR/BOARD REPORTING WITH VARIANCE AND FUNGIBILITY LIMITATIONS DISCLOSED. If FINANCE made accountable for operational accuracy not just external reporting compliance: Finance must validate aggregation methodology reflects operational reality (jurisdiction isolation disclosed, variance reported, fungibility assumptions caveated), finance bandwidth increases (operational data quality understanding beyond financial reporting audit scope), finance-operations collaboration increases (finance needs operations input to characterize operational constraints for investor disclosure), investor communications complexity increases (jurisdiction-specific metrics disclosed, 5-6x coordination multiplier visible Stage 4.3, operational heterogeneity apparent), investor perception of operational maturity may decline (complexity visible, integration narrative challenged, enterprise efficiency appears lower than aggregate-based narrative suggested). If OPERATIONS made accountable for investor communications accuracy: Operations must provide jurisdiction-specific data for external reporting (operations reporting burden increases), operations exposed to investor scrutiny (operational constraints visible externally, operations accountable for jurisdiction performance variance not just enterprise average), operations incentive to improve jurisdiction underperformance (if jurisdiction-specific metrics external, underperforming jurisdictions identified publicly creating performance pressure). If DISAGGREGATION MANDATED without clear accountability: Disaggregated metrics reported but interpretation contested—when jurisdiction variance visible, disputes over whether variance acceptable or problematic, disputes over which jurisdiction's performance represents enterprise capability, blame for underperforming jurisdictions unclear (operations blames resource allocation, finance blames operational execution, CEO arbitrates politically Stage 7.3 selective enforcement). CURRENT STATE preserves finance aggregation autonomy (methodology optimized for investor communication ease not operational accuracy), operations accepts execution risk without upstream accountability correction, investor narrative simplicity maintained at cost of operational misallocation and execution failures from variance erasure.",

  "synthesis_notes": "Six material data domains analyzed for accountability and blame flow. Pattern: FORMAL OWNERSHIP FRAGMENTED OR ABSENT, BLAME LANDS ON EXECUTION NOT METHODOLOGY. Deal profitability: Sales blamed (refresh Q3 2024) but methodology unchanged, delivery absorbs cost, CEO filters reactively, finance not blamed despite reporting inaccurate operational data. Customer counts: Orphaned—no owner, no blame, discrepancies tolerated indefinitely. Support ticketing: Support not blamed for incompleteness (SLA metrics preserved), CEO absorbs escalations without externalizing blame. Satisfaction: Orphaned—no owner, no blame, truth externalized to platforms. Incident frequency: Operations praised for response, prevention orphaned and blame externalized (threats, vendors, resources). Multi-jurisdictional aggregation: Finance not blamed for variance erasure, operations blamed for execution failures caused by aggregation. Blame pattern consistency: BLAME LANDS DOWNSTREAM (execution) NOT UPSTREAM (methodology/governance). Sales blamed not CRM qualification methodology. Delivery blamed not deal profitability validation absence. Operations blamed for execution not aggregation variance erasure. Support blamed when escalations become public not for measurement theater. Blame avoidance mechanisms: (1) Orphaned domains (customer counts, satisfaction) have no owner to blame. (2) Blame externalization (incident recurrence blamed on threats/vendors not prevention, satisfaction decline blamed on market not service). (3) Activity-outcome conflation protects upstream (SLA met protects support from satisfaction blame, MTTD/MTTR protects operations from frequency blame). (4) Finance insulation through external enforcement substitution (audit enforces financial accuracy, finance not accountable for operational data inaccuracy feeding financials). Touch test pattern: ENFORCING ACCOUNTABILITY BREAKS LOCAL OPTIMIZATION. If accountability enforced, functions must shift from controllable activity optimization (CRM bookings, SLA compliance, incident response) to uncontrollable outcome accountability (profitability, satisfaction, prevention)—harder, more expensive, politically contentious. Structural enablers of blame diffusion: Governance void (Stage 7.1 H7.1-B) means no systematic accountability assignment, authority-accountability gaps (Stage 4.1) enable blame landing on executors without authority (delivery blamed for profitability but no deal rejection authority), CEO bottleneck (Stage 4.2) forces reactive blame assignment through crisis arbitration not proactive accountability design, three CEOs three years (Stage 4.5) prevents accountability institutionalization across transitions."
