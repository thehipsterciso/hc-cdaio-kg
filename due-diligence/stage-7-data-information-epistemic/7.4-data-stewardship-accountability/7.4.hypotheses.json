Escalation TO CEO indicates GOVERNANCE VOID (Stage 7.1 H7.1-B)—systematic governance would resolve issues at lower organizational levels (operating committee for profitability disputes, data governance committee for quality issues, customer experience committee for escalations), escalation to CEO required because systematic resolution mechanisms absent, CEO becomes organizational SPOF for data issue resolution (Stage 4.2 CEO bottleneck worsened by escalation burden). Post-escalation RECURRENCE indicates incomplete resolution: CRM profitability issues likely continue (methodology unchanged, new personnel may repeat optimism), customer escalations continue (systematic path not built), incident recurrence continues (prevention orphaned)—symptoms treated creating temporary relief, causes remain creating recurrence. Hypothesis NOT FULLY REFUTED because escalation does produce action (walk away policy established, sales refresh executed, customer issues resolved)—but action INSUFFICIENT for systematic resolution (symptoms treated not causes fixed, episodic not institutional, recurrence likely). Escalation serves as PRESSURE RELEASE not SYSTEMATIC FIX—CEO intervention addresses immediate crisis (margin erosion stopped by deal filtering, immediate customer issue resolved), reduces escalation pressure temporarily, but structural issues enabling crisis persist (governance void, authority-accountability gaps, incentive misalignments) allowing recurrence."

Finance not blamed for aggregation methodology → misallocation continues. Customer identity not blamed (orphaned domain) → discrepancies persist. Satisfaction not blamed (orphaned domain) → deterioration continues. Pattern: Blame necessary but INSUFFICIENT for improvement—blame must land on SYSTEMS not INDIVIDUALS, must be ACCEPTED not EXTERNALIZED, must drive METHODOLOGY REFORM not PERSONNEL ROTATION. Blame landing on individuals (sales personnel) allows systems to persist. Blame externalization (incident recurrence blamed on threats not prevention) allows gaps to persist. Blame avoidance (support, finance insulation) removes pressure for improvement. Refutation indicates: Current blame patterns COUNTERPRODUCTIVE for quality improvement—blame focuses on execution (individuals, visible failures) not methodology (systems, root causes), produces scapegoating (individual turnover) not learning (process improvement), enables blame avoidance by system owners (sales methodology, finance aggregation, support ticketing unchanged despite failures). Quality improvement requires: Blame on METHODOLOGY not PEOPLE (CRM qualification process reformed not sales personnel replaced), blame ACCEPTANCE not EXTERNALIZATION (operations owns prevention not externalizes to threats), blame ASSIGNMENT in orphaned domains (customer identity steward blamed for reconciliation absence, satisfaction owner blamed for measurement gap)—current blame patterns avoid methodology/system accountability enabling persistence."
