      "status": "REFUTED",
      "notes": "Hypothesis refuted comprehensively. Every material domain exhibits parallel or contested truths. System of record ≠ system of truth pattern pervasive. CRM is system of record for sales but CEO walk away policy overrides CRM opportunity values. Support ticketing system of record for SLA but customer complaint platforms establish satisfaction truth externally. Finance general ledger system of record for margins but profitability by deal/customer contested between sales and delivery. Refutation indicates structural pattern: Authority-accountability misalignment (Stage 4.1) prevents unified truth—each function controls truth within domain, cross-functional truth negotiated or imposed by CEO reactively."

No data governance committee visible (Stage 4.1 governance infrastructure absent). Resolution political: CEO has authority not methodology, walk away policy case-by-case not criteria-based, sales refresh personnel change not data reconciliation. Three CEOs in three years indicates personal arbitration unsustainable (Stage 4.2 bottleneck, Stage 4.5 talent constraints). Refutation indicates governance void: Data conflicts symptom of authority-accountability misalignment (Stage 4.4), resolved reactively through CEO heroics not systematically through governance infrastructure."

      "notes": "Hypothesis decisively refuted. Internal activity truth systematically diverges from external outcome truth across all tested domains. Pattern: Incentive optimization favors measurable internal activities (SLA response, CRM entry, incident response, bookings volume) over hard-to-measure external outcomes (satisfaction, profitability, stability, quality). Divergence creates measurement theater (Stage 4.4): Internal metrics reported green while business deteriorates. Refutation indicates structural misalignment: Internal measurement systems designed for controllability (objective, immediate, directly influenced) not validity (predicting customer/financial outcomes). Activity-outcome divergence symptom of incentive misalignment—individuals rationally optimize measured activities while unmeasured outcomes degrade."

Data quality and authoritativeness not improving—disputes persistent despite CEO transitions (three in three years), reorganizations (2023 BU structure), personnel changes (sales refresh Q3 2024). Reactive interventions (walk away policy, sales refresh) address symptoms not causes—authority-accountability misalignment (Stage 4.1), incentive misalignment (Stage 4.4), governance void persist. No systematic data infrastructure investment visible—capital constrained ($1.3B debt Stage 5), CEO bottleneck (Stage 4.2) prevents governance building bandwidth. Pattern suggests degradation not improvement: Activity-outcome divergence widening (satisfaction 'consistently worse' 2024), margin erosion accelerating, CEO intervention necessity increasing. Refutation indicates: Data disputes symptom of structural execution constraints (authority gaps, incentive misalignments, coordination bottlenecks)—not improving because underlying structure unchanged."

  "synthesis_notes": "All hypotheses testing truth centralization, systematic governance, internal-external alignment, quality improvement either refuted or weakened. Pattern: Truth fragmented not centralized, governance reactive/political not systematic, internal activity diverges from external outcome, quality not improving potentially degrading. Refutations convergent: Point to structural root cause—authority-accountability misalignment (Stage 4.1), incentive misalignment (Stage 4.4), coordination bottlenecks (Stage 4.2), capital constraints (Stage 5). Data disputes symptomatic not causal—resolving data conflicts requires structural reform (authority reallocation, incentive realignment, governance infrastructure) not data management improvement. Three CEOs, sales refresh, walk away policy all fail to resolve data contestation because structural causes unchanged."
