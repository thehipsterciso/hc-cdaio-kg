      "type": "UNKNOWN",
      "decision_impact": "Cannot precisely map data flow, system integration points, where transformation occurs. Cannot assess technical vs political causes of contestation—if systems don't integrate, contestation may be technical limitation not political choice. Cannot evaluate data quality at system level—if systems unknown, data accuracy/completeness/timeliness assessment incomplete. Inference from organizational structure (400+ sales reps requires CRM, financial reporting requires ERP) and vendor citations (ScienceLogic monitoring Stage 4.3) but specific platforms, versions, integration architecture unknown.",
      "what_would_reduce_uncertainty": "IT architecture documentation: System inventory with business domain mapping, Data flow diagrams showing system-to-system integration or manual transfer, Platform vendor contracts and SKUs, Data warehouse/lake architecture if exists, BI tool stack and user access patterns, API integration map or ETL process documentation. Would clarify whether contestation caused by system fragmentation (technical) or authority fragmentation (political) or both."

Organizational resistance, capability deficit, executive support withdrawn, budget cut? If never attempted, why not? Prioritization (other initiatives took precedence), awareness (problem not recognized), capability (no expertise to design governance)? Cannot assess feasibility of governance solution—if tried and failed, repeating unlikely to succeed without addressing root failure causes. If never tried, may be feasible but requires capability/budget assessment.",
      "what_would_reduce_uncertainty": "Governance initiative history: Any data governance committees, councils, working groups created? When, charter, outcomes? Data quality initiatives past 5 years—tools procured, processes designed, success/failure? Chief Data Officer or equivalent role—ever existed, when eliminated if so? Data management consulting engagements—firms hired, recommendations, implementation? Budget allocated to data governance/quality—historical trend shows prioritization or deprioritization?"

      "type": "UNKNOWN",
      "decision_impact": "Cannot determine whether satisfaction truth absence deliberate (data exists but suppressed) or structural (data not collected). If collected and suppressed, indicates political sensitivity—satisfaction data so negative reporting would damage brand/investor confidence. If not collected, indicates measurement gap—support optimizing SLA without knowing customer impact. Cannot assess remediation approach—if data exists, making visible requires political will; if data absent, creating requires measurement infrastructure investment. External platforms (BBB, Trustpilot, Gartner) only source visible—may understate or overstate actual satisfaction depending on sample bias.",

To whom (executive team, Board, investors)? Historical satisfaction trends if measured? Satisfaction by customer segment, product, jurisdiction? Correlation analysis satisfaction vs churn? If not measured systematically, why not? Budget, capability, political resistance?"

Cannot determine whether profitability contestation solvable through better data or structural (sales-delivery coordination gap insurmountable). If profitability calculable, contestation political (sales/delivery/finance won't reconcile despite data). If profitability incalculable, contestation technical (cost allocation, delivery attribution, overhead assignment unsolved). Cannot evaluate M&A risk—if acquirer demands customer profitability data and Rackspace cannot produce, due diligence failure or valuation penalty.",

What allocation methodology (direct, activity-based, other)? Customer profitability P&Ls produced? Frequency, granularity, confidence level? Profitability by deal, customer segment, product line, jurisdiction? Walk away policy implementation process—what data CEO reviews when assessing deal profitability? If customer profitability not calculable, why not? Technical limitation (cost allocation complexity), system limitation (data not integrated), political resistance (delivery doesn't want visibility)?"

Cannot evaluate forecast reliability—if methodology inconsistent or judgmental, forecast accuracy uncertain. Cannot determine whether adjustment appropriate (corrects operational bias toward accuracy) or excessive (creates pessimism bias). Finance credibility with investors depends on adjustment producing accurate forecasts—methodology opacity creates verification impossibility.",

Historical accuracy of CRM-based forecast vs actual? How does finance adjust customer counts? Active revenue generators only, or includes contracted-but-not-paying? Margin forecast methodology—aggregates BU projections, applies corporate adjustments? Adjustment rationale documented and auditable? CFO judgment involved—qualitative overlays on quantitative models?"

If aggregation methodology flawed (ignores jurisdiction isolation, capacity non-fungibility), enterprise truth meaningless and decisions misguided. Cannot evaluate investor communications accuracy—if operational metrics presented without jurisdiction caveat, investors may misunderstand operational reality. Cannot determine infrastructure investment decisions—if enterprise utilization calculated but capacity not fungible across jurisdictions, investment may be misallocated.",
      "what_would_reduce_uncertainty": "Operations reporting and aggregation practices: How are jurisdiction-specific metrics aggregated for enterprise view? Simple sum, weighted average, consolidated? What weights if applicable? Capacity reported enterprise-wide—does reporting note capacity non-fungibility across jurisdictions? Utilization calculation—denominators account for jurisdiction isolation or assume fungible capacity? Investor/Board reporting—are multi-jurisdictional complexities disclosed or aggregated metrics presented without caveat? Operations dashboards—show jurisdictions separately or consolidated?"

  "synthesis_notes": "Uncertainties cluster around: (1) Technical infrastructure—systems, integration, data flow, (2) Governance history—whether tried and failed vs never attempted, (3) Measurement practices—customer satisfaction, deal profitability, operational aggregation, (4) Methodologies—finance adjustment, cost allocation, aggregation. Decision impact: Cannot distinguish technical from political contestation causes without system knowledge, cannot assess governance solution feasibility without history, cannot quantify truth gaps without methodology visibility. Uncertainties material to M&A—acquirer diligence likely to demand customer profitability, satisfaction data, operational metrics with methodology transparency. If Rackspace cannot produce or methodology defensibility weak, valuation risk or deal failure. Reducing uncertainty requires: IT architecture documentation, governance initiative history, measurement practice disclosure, methodology documentation—all likely exist internally but not publicly disclosed, require diligence access."
