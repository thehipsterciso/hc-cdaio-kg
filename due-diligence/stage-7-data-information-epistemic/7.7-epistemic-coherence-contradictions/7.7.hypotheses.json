(2) Walk away policy Q4 2024 per Stage 7.1 represents partial truth reconciliation attempt (CEO reviews deal profitability), but policy post-signature timing per Stage 7.6 means profitability triple truth persists pre-commitment (sales, delivery, finance still operate on divergent truths T0-T2, CEO reconciliation T5 too late to prevent commitment), policy reactive mitigation not systematic coherence establishment.

(2) Governance voids documented: No data governance per Stage 7.1 H7.1-B refutation (no CDO, no data governance committee despite material data quality issues), no operating committee per Stage 4.1 (coordination infrastructure absence enabling functional information silos and contradiction perpetuation), orphaned domains per Stage 7.4 (deal profitability validation, satisfaction measurement, customer count reconciliation all unowned). (3) Information asymmetries documented per Stage 7.5: Finance gatekeeping creates dual realities internal/external, CRM-delivery information silo from delivery lack of T0-T1 access, operations visibility of finance adjustment uncertain, Board operational data access uncertain. (4) Latency patterns per Stage 7.6 enabling parallel truths: Operations-finance forecast misalignment from sequential opacity (operations plans on operational truth, finance commits on adjusted truth, divergence persists weeks), deal profitability validation gap (commitment T2 before validation T3 means sales truth and delivery truth temporally separated enabling contradiction), Board quarterly latency (operational issues persist quarters before Board visibility creating information gap where contradictions can persist unaddressed). (5) Persistence across three CEO tenures per Stage 4.5: Each CEO operated within same contradictory information environment without resolution, contradictions structurally embedded not CEO-specific, durable across leadership changes indicating institutional acceptance not temporary gap."

Hypothesis claims functional data reconciles into unified reality; evidence shows functional autonomy per Stage 7.5 information asymmetry and Stage 4.1 coordination absence enabling functional data divergence without reconciliation (operations truth, finance truth, sales truth, delivery truth all coexist unreconciled). Hypothesis claims executives operate on shared factual understanding; evidence shows executives may operate on different truths depending on function (sales executives on CRM optimistic truth, finance executives on adjusted truth, delivery executives on cost reality truth, coordination absence means executive truths diverge). Hypothesis claims Board operates on shared understanding; evidence shows Board operational visibility uncertain per Stage 7.5 and Board quarterly latency per Stage 7.6 means Board may not see operational contradictions (Board governs on finance-filtered aggregates potentially masking operational incoherence underneath). Supporting evidence minimal (CRM system of record designation rhetorical, walk away policy partial mitigation not systematic coherence), disconfirming evidence comprehensive (four contradictions, governance voids, information asymmetries, latency patterns, CEO tenure persistence all contradict coherence claim).

Acquirer may discount valuation for information incoherence—pipeline value, customer base value, operational metrics all uncertain from competing truths, acquirer risk increases from information unreliability. Post-close acquirer may require extensive information architecture remediation—data governance establishment, system integration forcing reconciliation, measurement infrastructure building for absent truths (satisfaction, frequency), cultural change from contradiction tolerance to coherence requirement.",

Board would see operational reality coherently (operational metrics visible with known quality, Board aware of information architecture and confident in data integrity, Board oversight of data governance ensuring coherence maintained). Pattern opposite: Profitability truths diverge 13-15%, customer counts ambiguous, satisfaction unmeasured creating internal void while external contradicts brand, CRM trusted despite known inaccuracy, Board operational visibility uncertain and quarterly latency enables contradiction persistence invisible to Board."

Acquirer may increase valuation discount for contradiction persistence—if contradictions worsening (satisfaction deterioration 2024) or stable (CRM overstatement continuing) not improving, future performance vulnerable to continued contradiction impacts (further margin erosion, retention challenges, data quality decision impairment), discount reflects ongoing contradiction costs not one-time remediation.",

H7.7-A (coherent information model) decisively refuted by four major contradictions, governance voids, information asymmetries, latency patterns all documenting competing truths not single integrated truth system. H7.7-B (contradictions temporary/peripheral) decisively refuted by three CEO tenure persistence, no resolution initiatives, core business decision impacts, stable/worsening patterns all documenting contradictions durable and central not temporary edge cases. H7.7-C (executive alignment on shared reality) refuted by operating committee absence, operations-finance misalignment, information asymmetries affecting executives, CEO bottleneck from coordination gaps all documenting functional executive information silos not shared empirical understanding. CONSISTENT PATTERN: Enterprise functions through contradiction not despite it, contradictions structurally embedded and organizationally tolerated, coherence rhetorical not operational. HYPOTHESIS TESTING STRENGTHENS CONTRADICTORY ASSESSMENT: Actively sought evidence for coherence (supporting evidence for hypotheses), found minimal and insufficient, sought evidence against coherence (disconfirming evidence), found comprehensive and material. Falsification attempts confirm contradictory assessment with high confidence—alternative explanations (coherent model, temporary gaps, executive alignment) explicitly tested and refuted, remaining explanation is enterprise operates contradictorily with competing truths, persistent contradictions, and functional silos all serving organizational purposes (velocity, autonomy, accountability avoidance, coordination burden avoidance) outweighing coherence benefits in organizational revealed preference across three CEO tenures."
