Disconfirming searches comprehensive: sought evidence of decision-making without CEO bottleneck (not found), authority-accountability alignment (not found), formal coordination mechanisms (not found), autonomous BU execution (not found). Evidence convergent across multiple sources: three CEO transitions, authority analysis, escalation patterns. No confirmation bias detected—actively searched for structural reforms, governance mechanisms, delegation examples that would disconfirm bottleneck hypothesis."

Disconfirming searches documented: sought evidence of throughput improvement post-CEO transitions (not found), coordination mechanisms relieving bottleneck (not found), proactive vs reactive execution (proactive not found). Multi-jurisdictional 5-6x multiplier hypothesis tested across leadership changes—persistent across three CEOs confirms structural not individual. Activity-outcome divergence hypothesis validated across multiple metrics (SLA/satisfaction, bookings/margins, tickets/resolution)."

Disconfirming searches: sought evidence of failure containment (not found), dependency isolation mechanisms (not found), heroics as sustainable capability (refuted—heroics create fragility). CEO dependency hypothesis validated across three transitions—each transition disrupts coordination proving dependency systemic not individual. Sales-delivery cascade hypothesis quantified: margins -13%/-3%, revenue -7% evidence of negative-value propagation."

Disconfirming searches comprehensive: sought evidence of incentive realignment (not found—sales refresh changed personnel not comp structure), proactive structural reforms (not found—walk away policy reactive), capability deficits as root cause (refuted—capable individuals acting rationally under misaligned incentives). Drag persistence across personnel changes (three CEOs, sales refresh) validates structural hypothesis—rational behavior under incentive structure not individual failure."

Disconfirming searches rigorous: sought evidence of personnel changes improving execution (not found—three CEOs recreate bottleneck), talented individuals overcoming constraints (not found—heroics workarounds not sustainable solutions), smooth turnover transitions (not found—coordination collapses). Hypothesis validated: system constraints neutralize talent, heroics mask fragility, turnover amplifies risk. Personnel optimization insufficient—structural reform necessary."

Each sub-stage tested structural vs individual explanations, actively searched for disconfirming evidence, updated hypotheses when evidence contradicted. Three CEO transitions and sales refresh provide natural experiments validating structural hypotheses—if individual performance were cause, personnel changes would resolve, but patterns persist unchanged. Confirmation bias risk low—evidence convergent from multiple independent sources, disconfirming searches comprehensive, uncertainty preserved appropriately."
