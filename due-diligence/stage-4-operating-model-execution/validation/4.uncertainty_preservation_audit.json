Actual attrition data would materially change risk assessment—active attrition requires immediate intervention, prospective allows time for prevention.",

    "uncertainty_preservation_quality": "HIGH—Stage 4 consistently distinguishes FACT from INFERENCE, documents unknowns explicitly, preserves UNKNOWN vs UNKNOWABLE classifications, avoids false precision. Where evidence exists (three CEO transitions, margin data, customer complaints), claims stated confidently. Where evidence inference or unavailable (attrition rates, incentive structure details, capability assessments), uncertainty preserved and documented in registers. No narrative smoothing of gaps—contradictions and tensions preserved rather than resolved artificially. Unknowns requests prioritize material uncertainties for information gathering. Overall: rigorous uncertainty discipline maintained throughout Stage 4."
