      "why_it_matters": "Creates impossible situation: BU Presidents blamed for P&L results they cannot control, rational to escalate everything to CEO creating bottleneck, CEO too overloaded to delegate authority or build governance infrastructure enabling delegation. Self-reinforcing trap—CEO overload prevents delegation, lack of delegation perpetuates overload.",

      "why_it_matters": "Policy conflicts with incentive structure—sales still compensated on bookings, rational to book deals, CEO must personally enforce walk away. Creates CEO dependency for policy compliance. If CEO bandwidth exhausted or transitions occur, policy enforcement lapses, negative-value deals resume. Sales refresh Q3 2024 changed personnel not incentives—suggests policy compliance relies on CEO intervention not sales self-regulation.",

Walk away policy Q4 2024, sales refresh Q3 2024 reactive after severe deterioration—activity metrics masked severity.",

Creates false sense that system functional—issues eventually resolved (support), incidents eventually contained (operations), results maintained (CEO). Prevents recognition system broken until heroics capacity exhausted. Then catastrophic failure: support resolution collapses, operations incident response degrades, CEO transitions create coordination collapse.

But talent retention critical—attrition destroys irreplaceable knowledge (legacy custodians), networks (support informal coordination), capacity (heroics zones).

BU accountability without authority creates escalation loading CEO bottleneck preventing delegation. Walk away policy without incentive realignment requires CEO enforcement creating bottleneck dependency. Activity-outcome divergence masks deterioration delaying structural intervention recognition. Heroics mask fragility until catastrophic—prevents proactive reform until crisis. Talent asymmetry (additions insufficient, attrition catastrophic) indicates structural reform necessary but talent retention critical during transition. Contradictions cannot be resolved through optimization—structural redesign required but constraints prevent implementation."
