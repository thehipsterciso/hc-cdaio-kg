CEO bottleneck prevents structural reform—no bandwidth to build governance infrastructure (operating committee, deal review board) that would relieve bottleneck.

Heroics mask constraint severity—temporary workarounds prevent crisis forcing reform. Talent neutralization indicates personnel optimization insufficient—structural changes required. Multiple constraints HIGH severity—indicates execution fragility material, compounding, accelerating."
