      "hypothesis_tested": "H4.5-A: System constraints neutralize talent capability—adding capable individuals doesn't improve execution materially",
      "disconfirming_evidence_sought": "Personnel changes materially improving execution without structural reform, Talented individuals changing outcomes despite structural constraints, Hiring resolving execution failures, Talent overcoming system constraints without heroics",
      "search_conducted": "Examined personnel change events for execution improvement: Three CEO transitions (Jones to Maletira to Kandiah)—did organizational throughput improve with any CEO change?, sales refresh Q3 2024—did margin erosion stop or slow?, any new leadership hires cited as improving execution (VP Support creation, CRO appointment, other structural role additions?). Searched for examples of talent capability overcoming structural gaps: Support staff resolving customer issues despite authority gap—sustainable or heroic?, operations preventing incidents despite reactive incentive structure, sales achieving profitability despite bookings-based compensation, delivery improving margins despite unprofitable deal flow. Searched for structural reforms enabling talent effectiveness: Authority reallocation (VP Support, operating committee, deal review board creation), incentive realignment (outcome-based measurement), governance infrastructure (coordination process, escalation frameworks).",
      "evidence_found": "NONE disconfirming. Personnel changes don't improve execution materially: Three CEOs—bottleneck recreates with each (Stage 4.2 serial processing persists across all three), sales refresh Q3 2024—margin erosion continues (Private Cloud -13%, Public Cloud -3% after refresh), no VP Support or structural role additions visible (Stage 4.1 authority analysis shows gaps persist). Talent capability deployed heroically not effectively: Support 'dozens of engineers' coordination is heroic workaround not effective solution (BBB complaints persist, Trustpilot satisfaction declining), operations multi-month crisis response is heroic but incidents recurring (ransomware, zero-day, pattern suggests prevention gap not filled), walk away policy Q4 2024 is CEO heroic intervention not sales self-regulation (requires ongoing enforcement). No structural reforms identified: No operating committee created, no deal review board established, no VP Support role added, no incentive realignment (sales still bookings-based inference, support still SLA-based inference), no authority reallocation (BU Presidents still lack cross-functional authority Stage 4.1).",
      "conclusion": "Disconfirming evidence NOT FOUND. Personnel changes recreate same execution patterns—three CEOs inherit identical bottleneck, sales refresh doesn't resolve margin erosion. Talent deployed in heroic mode masks structural gaps—support/operations/delivery/CEO all executing heroically to compensate for authority/incentive/governance gaps. No structural reforms to enable talent effectiveness—all interventions personnel/policy focused (reactive) not structural. Hypothesis remains supported: System constraints defeat talent capability, adding individuals insufficient without structural reform."

      "hypothesis_tested": "H4.5-B: Heroics mask system fragility—sustained heroic execution creates illusion of capability while accumulating burnout risk",
      "disconfirming_evidence_sought": "Heroic execution recognized and proactively addressed through structural reform, Heroic zones receiving authority/resources/process support, Burnout prevented through workload management, System fragility visible and addressed before heroics capacity exhaustion",
      "search_conducted": "Searched for recognition that heroic execution unsustainable and structural reform needed: Any statements about eliminating heroic dependencies?, any initiatives to systematize informal coordination?, any burnout or sustainability concerns raised in disclosures?, any workforce capacity planning or workload management programs? Searched for structural support to heroic zones: VP Support role creation to eliminate support informal coordination heroics?, CRO role creation to shift operations from reactive heroics to proactive prevention?, operating committee creation to distribute CEO coordination load?, deal review board to eliminate delivery heroics executing unprofitable deals? Searched for proactive interventions before crisis: Any proactive governance infrastructure creation (not reactive policies after crisis)?, any proactive incentive realignment (not reactive personnel changes)?, any proactive authority reallocation (not reactive CEO intervention)?",
      "evidence_found": "NONE disconfirming. No recognition of heroics as unsustainable problem: No statements about systematizing informal coordination, no burnout or sustainability concerns in public disclosures (though three CEOs three years speaks volumes), no workforce capacity planning visible, interventions treat outcomes (margin erosion, satisfaction decline) not heroics root cause. No structural support to heroic zones: No VP Support created (Stage 4.1 authority gap persists), no CRO created (Stage 4.1 reactive risk posture only), no operating committee created (Stage 4.1 CEO sole coordinator), no deal review board created (Stage 4.1 accountability void persists). All interventions reactive not proactive: Walk away policy Q4 2024 after severe margin erosion (reactive), sales refresh Q3 2024 after margin deterioration visible (reactive), CEO transitions likely after Board loses confidence in results (reactive), no proactive structural reforms before crises. System fragility revealed through failures not recognized proactively: Customer complaints surfacing (BBB, Trustpilot), financial deterioration (revenue -7%, margins -13%/-3%), CEO unsustainability (three in three years).",
      "conclusion": "Disconfirming evidence NOT FOUND. Heroic execution not recognized as systemic problem—treated as normal operating mode. Heroic zones receive no structural support—authority gaps, incentive misalignments, governance voids persist. All interventions reactive after heroics capacity exhausted and failures surface—no proactive recognition that heroics unsustainable. System fragility accumulating invisibly until catastrophic: Customer satisfaction declining gradually then complaints surface, margins eroding gradually then walk away policy forced, CEO coordination gradually overloading then turnover. Hypothesis remains supported: Heroics mask fragility, create illusion of capability, failures emerge only when heroics capacity depleted."

      "disconfirming_evidence_sought": "Turnover managed smoothly through succession planning, Documented knowledge and formal processes enabling rapid replacement, Execution continuity during personnel changes, Succession infrastructure or knowledge management systems evidence",
      "search_conducted": "Searched for succession planning and knowledge transfer infrastructure: Any succession planning disclosures (CEO succession plan, key person succession plans)?, any knowledge management systems or documentation initiatives?, any transition management processes for critical roles?, any mention of institutional knowledge preservation or transfer? Searched for smooth turnover transitions: Did any CEO transition occur smoothly without execution disruption?, any evidence of seamless knowledge transfer in critical roles?, any examples of turnover with maintained execution continuity? Searched for documented processes reducing turnover risk: Are coordination processes documented (support cross-functional procedures, operations incident runbooks, multi-jurisdictional deployment procedures)?, is institutional knowledge systematized (legacy system documentation, vendor relationship procedures, compliance controls documentation)?",
      "evidence_found": "NONE disconfirming. No succession planning or knowledge transfer infrastructure visible: No CEO succession plan evident (three unplanned transitions suggest reactive not planned), no knowledge management systems mentioned, no transition management processes, no institutional knowledge preservation initiatives. CEO transitions disruptive not smooth: Three CEOs in three years with financial deterioration (revenue -7%, margins -13%/-3%) coinciding suggests disruption not continuity, walk away policy Q4 2024 and sales refresh Q3 2024 reactive interventions under third CEO suggest execution recovery needed after transitions. Processes informal not documented: Support coordination informal ('dozens of engineers' coordination not systematized), operations incident response tribal (multi-month ransomware response suggests no established runbooks), legacy system knowledge tribal not documented (15+ year history with ownership transitions creates fragmentation), multi-jurisdictional procedures separate not harmonized (5-6x multiplier indicates no common framework).",
      "conclusion": "Disconfirming evidence NOT FOUND. No succession planning infrastructure—CEO transitions reactive not planned, knowledge transfer capability absent. Turnover creates disruption not continuity—three CEO transitions correlate with financial deterioration. Processes and knowledge informal/tribal not documented—support coordination, operations response, legacy systems all depend on individual knowledge. Hypothesis remains supported: Turnover amplifies execution risk disproportionately because knowledge concentration and informal processes prevent smooth succession. Normal turnover manageable with documentation/systems, catastrophic without."

      "disconfirming_evidence_sought": "Heroic zones with stable tenure and low turnover, Individuals sustaining heroics indefinitely without burnout, Successful recruitment for known-heroic roles without difficulty, Sustainable heroic execution evidence",
      "search_conducted": "Searched for stable tenure in heroic zones: CEO tenure stability (three in three years factual—highly unstable), support staff tenure patterns (inferred from satisfaction decline and heroics dependency), operations team tenure (inferred from burnout risk and multi-month crises), any long-tenured leaders in coordination-heavy roles? Searched for evidence individuals sustaining heroics without burnout: Any examples of individuals sustaining CEO coordination load successfully for extended periods?, any support staff sustaining 'dozens of engineers' coordination indefinitely?, any operations teams sustaining multi-month crisis cycles repeatedly without attrition?

      "evidence_found": "NONE disconfirming. Heroic zones highly unstable: CEO three in three years—extreme instability indicates role defeats tenure, support staff presumably churning (satisfaction declining despite heroics suggests capacity loss from attrition), operations burnout risk HIGH from multi-month sustained crises (evidence suggests unsustainable). No evidence of indefinite heroics sustainability: Three CEO limit suggests role eventually defeats all individuals regardless of capability, support satisfaction declining despite heroics suggests heroics insufficient to maintain outcomes indefinitely (heroics degrading over time or staff capacity declining from attrition), operations multi-month crises imply extended unsustainable effort. No evidence of easy recruitment: Three CEO transitions in three years suggests either Board dissatisfaction with all three (unlikely all three inadequate) OR role inherently difficult making recruitment challenging, 'Fanatical Support' brand promise vs declining satisfaction reality may make support recruitment harder (word of mouth about heroics requirement).",
      "conclusion": "Disconfirming evidence NOT FOUND. Heroic zones experience high instability—CEO factual, support/operations inferred but consistent with burnout patterns. No individuals sustain heroics indefinitely—three CEO limit demonstrates eventual burnout/departure, satisfaction decline suggests support heroics degrading over time. Recruitment presumably challenging for known-heroic roles—why take CEO role after three predecessors in three years? Why join support if 'Fanatical' brand reality is heroic informal coordination? Hypothesis remains supported: Heroic zones attract capable individuals initially, burn them out through structural unsustainability, create churn in most critical roles. Talent trap pattern clear—heroics requirement defeats all individuals eventually regardless of capability."
