      "heroic_behavior_required": "Support staff must coordinate 'dozens of engineers' (BBB) informally without authority to achieve customer issue resolution. Heroic behaviors: Navigate cross-functional organization without routing system—personally identify billing/delivery/engineering contacts, negotiate prioritization without authority to compel—persuade rather than direct, track resolution across unintegrated systems—manual status coordination, maintain pressure until resolution—substitute persistence for process, absorb customer frustration during extended resolution—emotional labor without tools. Coordination overhead consuming support capacity—activity exceeding productive work (Stage 4.2). SLA response times met through heroic effort while actual resolution requires extended informal coordination.",
      "why_it_is_structural": "Support lacks formal authority and system support: No VP Support or empowered coordinator (Stage 4.1)—authority gap structural, no cross-functional ticketing or workflow system—coordination purely informal, no SLAs for cross-functional response—cannot enforce timelines, no escalation path with teeth—customer cannot reach CEO (BBB). Incentive structure measures SLA response not resolution (Stage 4.4)—heroics required to achieve unmeasured outcome. Authority void structural (Stage 4.4): Customer resolution accountability split across support/billing/delivery/engineering without unified owner. System requires heroics by design—formal coordination mechanism absent. Personnel changes don't resolve—new support staff must recreate informal networks, relationships, tribal knowledge. Support heroics mask coordination void—issues eventually resolved preventing complete failure but at unsustainable human cost.",
      "burnout_or_continuity_risk": "Burnout risk HIGH: Support staff coordinating dozens of engineers per issue—coordination overhead unsustainable, emotional labor absorbing customer frustration during extended resolution, heroic effort required for baseline expectation (issue resolution)—not exceptional circumstances. Continuity risk HIGH: Coordination depends on personal relationships and tribal knowledge—attrition breaks networks, institutional knowledge concentrated in individuals—not systematized or documented, replacement staff cannot immediately replicate heroic coordination—learning curve extended. Customer satisfaction declining despite heroics (Trustpilot 'consistently worse' 2024)—heroics insufficient, masks severity but doesn't prevent deterioration. Attrition inevitable under sustained heroic demand—burnout creates turnover, turnover increases burden on remaining staff (death spiral), 'Fanatical Support' brand promise unsustainable—heroics-dependent model fragile.",

Heroic behaviors: Extended on-call rotations beyond sustainable levels, parallel crisis and operational workload without additional capacity, improvised incident response without established runbooks (each crisis unique), personal relationship leverage with vendors to accelerate remediation (informal influence not contractual SLA).",
      "why_it_is_structural": "Operations operates in reactive-only posture without proactive prevention: No CRO or proactive risk governance (Stage 4.1)—prevention unfunded structurally, operations incentive on incident response speed not frequency reduction (Stage 4.4)—heroic response rewarded, proactive work invisible/unrewarded, reactive spending pattern (Stage 4.2)—incidents force spending exceeding prevention cost, but prevention budget unavailable until crisis, vendor dependencies create external constraints (ScienceLogic zero-day remediation timeline uncontrollable)—operations heroics cannot compensate for vendor limitations, monitoring degradation (Sept 2024 dashboards offline)—crisis occurs when visibility impaired. System generates incidents operations must absorb: Engineering prioritizes features over stability (Stage 4.4: technical debt accumulation), multi-jurisdictional complexity (5-6x operational multiplier) increases incident surface area, capital constraints ($1.3B debt) limit proactive investment—prevention perpetually deferred. Heroics substitute for structural prevention—operations fighting fires system continually generates.",
      "burnout_or_continuity_risk": "Burnout risk HIGH: Multi-month incidents require sustained extraordinary effort—not brief heroics, 24/7 on-call extended beyond normal rotation sustainability, crisis cycles create no recovery periods—ransomware multi-month, then zero-day, then next incident, heroic response expected as baseline—not recognized as exceptional. Continuity risk HIGH: Incident response expertise concentrated in crisis responders—tribal knowledge of system failure modes, vendor escalation procedures depend on personal relationships—not contractual SLAs, replacement staff lack crisis experience and vendor relationships—learning curve during crisis unacceptable. Regulatory risk: FedRAMP, HIPAA/HITRUST require timely incident management—burnout-induced attrition degrades response capability, extended MTTR from capacity loss creates compliance jeopardy.

Heroic behaviors: Serial processing of coordination queue—CEO becomes organizational bottleneck (Stage 4.2), personal intervention maintains quarterly results—organizational throughput dependent on CEO bandwidth, informal coordination through personal networks—no repeatable process, extended hours processing coordination workload—unsustainable individual load. CEO consumed by operational coordination—strategic focus impossible.",
      "why_it_is_structural": "Authority architecture centralizes all cross-functional authority with CEO: No operating committee to distribute coordination load (Stage 4.1), no deal review board to assess profitability—CEO approval required, no empowered coordinators to resolve cross-functional issues—CEO sole adjudicator, BU Presidents lack authority despite P&L accountability (Stage 4.1)—rational to escalate to CEO. 2023 reorganization created BU structure but didn't reallocate authority—coordination void persists structurally. System design requires CEO heroics: Cross-functional conflicts have no resolution mechanism below CEO, major decisions have no delegation framework—CEO must personally process, accountability voids (Stage 4.4: deal profitability, customer resolution) default to CEO when no unified owner exists. Three CEOs in three years (Jones, Maletira, Kandiah)—heroic coordination pattern recreates with each CEO regardless of individual capability. System defeats CEO competence—coordination load exceeds any individual capacity.",

Continuity risk EXTREME: CEO transitions create coordination collapse—informal networks break, new CEO must rebuild coordination patterns—learning curve during execution crisis, institutional knowledge lost with each transition—three transitions in three years compounds knowledge fragmentation, organizational throughput drops during transition—execution dependent on CEO personal intervention. Each CEO turnover increases organizational fragility—coordination capability degrading, execution risk compounding.

Continuity risk HIGH: Delivery expertise concentrated in individuals executing heroically—tribal knowledge of workarounds, customer relationships strained by execution failures—attrition breaks continuity, replacement staff inherit impossible commitments without context—learning curve under execution pressure.

System design requires heroic manual coordination—automation blocked by regulatory boundaries. Capital constraints ($1.3B debt) limit investment in jurisdiction harmonization.
