Sounds like perfect competition market dynamics where buyer has power.",

Stage 6.2 cloud dependency map documents: (1) AWS exit cost $50-150M, timeline >24 months, LOW feasibility, (2) Azure exit cost $50-150M, timeline >24 months, LOW feasibility, (3) Google Cloud exit cost $15-50M, timeline 12-18 months, MED feasibility but still difficult. ANY hyperscaler exit cost ($15-150M) EXCEEDS discretionary capital ($10-35M per Stage 5.2) and timeline exceeds liquidity runway (5-15 months per Stage 5.3). Cannot actually exit ANY hyperscaler within survival constraints - 'optionality' is THEORETICAL not OPERATIONAL. Hyperscalers KNOW exit is irrational and price accordingly - Rackspace has ZERO credible threat to switch, therefore ZERO pricing leverage.",

NO - migration takes >24 months and costs $50-150M (5-15X discretionary capital). Must accept AWS pricing or lose customers who switch to hyperscaler-direct.

Public Cloud managed services model (Stage 2.1) is management layer ON TOP of hyperscaler infrastructure - customers build applications using AWS services (Lambda, RDS, S3), Azure services (Functions, SQL Database, Blob Storage), or Google Cloud services (Cloud Functions, Cloud SQL, Cloud Storage). These are NOT INTERCHANGEABLE - AWS Lambda code cannot run on Azure Functions without rewrite, RDS cannot migrate to Azure SQL without schema/compatibility work, S3 APIs differ from Azure Blob Storage. Rackspace provides MANAGEMENT not ABSTRACTION - monitoring, optimization, support, billing consolidation. Moving customer from AWS to Azure requires: (1) Customer application rewrite/refactor (weeks to months), (2) Data migration (complex for large databases/storage), (3) Testing and validation (cannot risk production), (4) Cutover coordination (downtime or complex failover). This is CUSTOMER RESPONSIBILITY not Rackspace capability. Rackspace cannot unilaterally move workloads - requires customer consent, project funding, acceptance of risk. 'Seamless portability' is FICTION.",

Customers will REFUSE - complexity too high, risk too great. Most will either: (1) Accept Rackspace price increase to cover lost margin (some churn), OR (2) Move to Azure-direct or different Azure partner (Rackspace loses customer).

Rackspace has multi-cloud CAPABILITY (partners with AWS, Azure, Google Cloud), but CUSTOMERS typically choose ONE cloud per workload/application. Customer deployed on AWS does NOT have automatic Azure failover - their application is AWS-specific. If AWS has outage, that customer's workload goes down REGARDLESS of Rackspace having Azure partnership. Similarly, if AWS has business disruption (unlikely but theoretically possible), customer on AWS is impacted - cannot instantly failover to Azure without application rewrite. Rackspace multi-cloud presence provides resilience for RACKSPACE REVENUE (can sell multiple clouds, not dependent on single hyperscaler commercial relationship) but does NOT provide resilience for CUSTOMER OPERATIONS (each customer is single-cloud deployed). Customer-level single vendor risk remains - multi-cloud does not eliminate it.",

NEAR ZERO - would require: (1) Pre-deployed parallel Azure infrastructure (customers don't pay for this - doubles cost), (2) Application compatibility across both clouds (rarely exists without specific design), (3) Data replication AWS→Azure (bandwidth costs, replication lag, data consistency). Most customers have AWS-only deployment - outage impacts them fully. Rackspace having Azure partnership does NOT help customers survive AWS outage.

Maintaining EXPERT-LEVEL knowledge across all three requires: (1) 3X training investment (certifications, ongoing education, conference attendance), (2) 3X tooling investment (monitoring, automation, orchestration for each cloud), (3) 3X operational complexity (incident response procedures differ by provider). For SAME REVENUE, multi-cloud is MORE EXPENSIVE than single-cloud specialization. Evidence: Most successful cloud providers SPECIALIZE (Databricks on AWS/Azure, Snowflake on AWS/Azure/Google but abstracts infrastructure).

Rackspace INHERITS customer's cloud choice, does not make it. For new customers, cloud selection driven by: (1) Existing enterprise agreements with hyperscalers (Azure if Microsoft shop, AWS if Amazon relationship), (2) Incumbent workloads (Azure if migrating from Windows Server, AWS if existing AWS presence), (3) Compliance requirements (GovCloud, specific certifications), (4) Staff expertise (use cloud team already knows).

Customer will REFUSE - 20% savings does not justify migration cost/risk/disruption. Rackspace must manage Azure environment as-is.
