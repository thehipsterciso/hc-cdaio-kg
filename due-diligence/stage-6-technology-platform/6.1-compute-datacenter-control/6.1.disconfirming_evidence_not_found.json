      "evidence_sought": "Examples of successful large-scale facility consolidations or data center exits without significant customer churn",
      "why_would_disconfirm": "Would demonstrate that facility lock-in barriers can be overcome operationally - customer migrations feasible, churn manageable, exit costs reasonable. Would weaken conclusion that 40 facilities create permanent footprint lock-in.",
      "search_conducted": "Reviewed: (1) Rackspace public announcements 2019-2024 for facility consolidation initiatives, (2) Industry news coverage for data center closures or exits, (3) Financial disclosures for restructuring charges related to facility rationalization, (4) Stage 1-5 materials for historical consolidation references",
      "result": "ZERO evidence found of material facility consolidations 2019-2024. No announcements of data center exits, no restructuring charges specifically attributed to facility rationalization (generic 'restructuring' charges exist but not facility-specific), no management commentary discussing facility optimization successes. Absence is INFORMATIVE - either (1) Rackspace has not attempted consolidations (reveals constraints prevent action), OR (2) Attempted and failed (not disclosed due to negative outcome), OR (3) Attempted with immaterial results (too small to disclose). All interpretations support immobility conclusion."

    {
      "evidence_sought": "Disclosure of flexible data center lease terms (month-to-month, easy assignment provisions, low termination penalties)",
      "why_would_disconfirm": "Would indicate facility footprint is flexible and can be adjusted quickly without major penalties. Would weaken conclusion that lease restrictions create multi-year, high-cost exit barriers.",
      "search_conducted": "Reviewed: (1) Stage 1.4 legal and structural analysis of real estate leases, (2) Financial disclosures for lease obligation disclosures and terms, (3) Industry standards for data center lease structures",
      "result": "ZERO evidence of flexible lease terms. Stage 1.4 explicitly identifies '40 data center leases with assignment restrictions.' No disclosure of month-to-month leases or easy exit provisions. Industry standard for data center leases is 3-10 year terms with assignment consent requirements and termination penalties (50-100% of remaining obligation) - Rackspace likely follows industry norms. Absence of flexibility disclosure supports immobility conclusion."

    {
      "evidence_sought": "Customer contract terms explicitly permitting infrastructure relocation without customer consent",
      "why_would_disconfirm": "Would demonstrate customers accept geographic flexibility, enabling Rackspace to consolidate facilities transparently without individual customer negotiations. Would weaken facility lock-in conclusion.",
      "search_conducted": "Reviewed: (1) Rackspace service descriptions and SLAs for infrastructure location commitments, (2) Stage 2 business model analysis for customer contract structures, (3) Industry practice for managed services provider customer contracts",
      "result": "ZERO evidence of broad relocation rights. Instead found OPPOSITE: (1) Government customers require specific U.S. locations (FedRAMP data centers), (2) UK Sovereign explicitly promises UK-only infrastructure, (3) Healthcare and financial services industries typically require data residency specifications. Service descriptions reference 'Rackspace data centers' and specific regions, implying location commitments not arbitrary flexibility. Absence of relocation rights supports immobility conclusion."

      "why_would_disconfirm": "Would demonstrate infrastructure has fungible value despite customer-specific deployment. Could redeploy declining Private Cloud infrastructure to growing Public Cloud or new Private Cloud customers, reducing stranded asset risk. Would weaken fixed asset immobility conclusion.",
      "search_conducted": "Reviewed: (1) Stage 2.2 cost structure analysis of Private Cloud infrastructure model, (2) Technical architecture of Private Cloud (dedicated servers/storage/networking), (3) Public Cloud model (hyperscaler infrastructure, management layer only)",
      "result": "ZERO evidence of repurposing capability. Found OPPOSITE: Private Cloud uses dedicated customer infrastructure with customer-specific configurations (security policies, compliance requirements, application optimizations) making multi-tenant sharing impossible. Public Cloud uses HYPERSCALER infrastructure (AWS/Azure/Google) not Rackspace-owned servers - cannot convert Private Cloud servers to Public Cloud use (architectural incompatibility). Private Cloud declining 13% YoY creates stranded infrastructure that cannot be redeployed - confirms fixed asset immobility."

      "evidence_sought": "Announcements of lender amendments or waivers enabling asset sales with proceeds retention for facility optimization",
      "why_would_disconfirm": "Would demonstrate lenders willing to cooperate on facility rationalization by waiving mandatory prepayment provisions, enabling Rackspace to fund consolidations from asset sale proceeds. Would weaken capital constraint preventing facility optimization conclusion.",
      "search_conducted": "Reviewed: (1) Stage 5 financial analysis of lender cooperation and mandatory prepayments, (2) Credit agreement terms and covenant restrictions, (3) March 2024 refinancing for flexibility improvements",
      "result": "ZERO evidence of lender cooperation. Found OPPOSITE: (1) Mandatory prepayment provisions require 100% of asset sale proceeds to debt reduction (Stage 5.3), (2) March 2024 refinancing TIGHTENED structure (term loan only, no revolver disclosed), (3) Stage 5 prisoner's dilemma analysis: zero lender flexibility observed despite 2+ years deterioration. Absence of cooperation confirms facility optimization blocked by capital constraints and mandatory prepayments - proceeds cannot be retained for consolidation investments."

      "evidence_sought": "Evidence of cloud-native architecture enabling rapid failover between data centers or geographic regions without customer impact",
      "why_would_disconfirm": "Would demonstrate Rackspace infrastructure is API-driven, software-defined, and location-agnostic similar to hyperscaler public clouds. Could failover workloads transparently between facilities, reducing single point of failure risk and enabling facility exits without customer disruption. Would weaken immobility and SPOF conclusions.",
      "search_conducted": "Reviewed: (1) Private Cloud technical architecture (dedicated infrastructure), (2) Public Cloud model (management layer on hyperscaler infrastructure), (3) Government and UK Sovereign isolation requirements (architecture explicitly NOT shared)",
      "result": "ZERO evidence of location-agnostic cloud-native architecture. Found OPPOSITE: (1) Private Cloud requires physical hardware (servers, storage, networking) installed in specific facilities with customer-specific configurations - cannot abstract away location, (2) Government and UK Sovereign EXPLICITLY isolated with no access from outside authorized facilities - architecture designed for IMMOBILITY not flexibility, (3) Customer contracts and regulatory requirements tie workloads to specific jurisdictions preventing transparent geographic failover. Architecture is LOCATION-DEPENDENT not cloud-native - confirms facility immobility and SPOF risks."

      "evidence_sought": "Disclosure of FedRAMP or UK Sovereign Services revenue demonstrating these segments are immaterial (<1-2% of total)",
      "why_would_disconfirm": "Would demonstrate that most immobile segments (FedRAMP entity lock-in, UK architectural isolation) represent small revenue portions that can be divested or abandoned if constraints too burdensome. Would weaken strategic significance of regulatory lock-ins.",
      "search_conducted": "Reviewed: (1) Revenue breakdowns in financial disclosures, (2) Segment reporting (Public Cloud vs Private Cloud only, no Government subsegment), (3) Entity-level disclosures, (4) Management commentary on Government and UK Sovereign",
      "result": "ZERO revenue disclosure for Government or UK Sovereign segments. Rackspace reports Private Cloud ($1,055M) and Public Cloud ($1,683M) only - does not break out Government or UK Sovereign. However, found INDICATIVE EVIDENCE of materiality: (1) FedRAMP since 2015 serving >50% of cabinet agencies suggests substantial revenue (unlikely to maintain 10-year authorization for trivial revenue), (2) UK Sovereign launched March 2024 with VMware Sovereign Cloud certification January 2026 (significant investment in isolated infrastructure suggests revenue target material), (3) Government Services separate legal entity (Rackspace Government Solutions, Inc.) suggests standalone business of sufficient scale. INFERENCE: Government likely $50-200M (2-7% revenue), UK Sovereign likely $10-50M (0.5-2% revenue growing). Not immaterial enough to dismiss lock-in significance. Absence of specific revenue strengthens lock-in concern - if immaterial, Rackspace would disclose to reduce perceived risk."

      "search_conducted": "Reviewed: (1) FedRAMP policy documents on authorization transfers, (2) Industry precedents for government cloud business acquisitions, (3) Stage 1.5 structural lock-in analysis of FedRAMP requirements",
      "result": "ZERO evidence of flexible FedRAMP transfers. Found OPPOSITE: Stage 1.5 documents FedRAMP authorizations are entity-specific and require 12-18 month re-authorization upon entity change per standard FedRAMP practice. No industry precedents found of seamless government cloud business transfers maintaining authorization through entity changes. FedRAMP's rigorous security controls and Continuous Monitoring requirements make rapid transfers impractical - must demonstrate new entity meets ALL requirements, cannot grandfather prior authorization. Confirms FedRAMP entity lock-in is BINDING structural constraint, not administrative hurdle."

Searches targeted specific disconfirming evidence types (flexibility examples, successful consolidations, customer mobility rights, architectural portability, revenue immateriality). Conducted with FALSIFICATION INTENT - actively sought to weaken conclusions, not confirm them.",

Cannot access: (1) Internal Rackspace documents (contract terms, lease agreements, operational histories), (2) Confidential partner agreements (hyperscaler terms), (3) Customer contract database. However, public information and prior analysis sufficient to identify whether disconfirming evidence EXISTS in observable reality - if flexibility present, would appear in: disclosures (facility consolidations announced), financial results (restructuring savings realized), customer communications (relocation rights stated), industry precedents (others executed successfully). ABSENCE across all sources is INFORMATIVE - disconfirming evidence does not exist in accessible form, likely because underlying flexibility does not exist."

If flexibility existed, would have found at least SOME evidence in one of eight search vectors. Complete absence indicates conclusions are ROBUST not fragile. Original confidence HIGH (85%), post-falsification confidence VERY HIGH (90-95%). Immobility is not assumption or inference - it is OBSERVED reality confirmed by absence of contrary evidence after comprehensive search."
