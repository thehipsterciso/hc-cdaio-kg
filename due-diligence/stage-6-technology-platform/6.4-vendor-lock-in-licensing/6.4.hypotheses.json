Vendors KNOW Rackspace is locked in and price accordingly - no incentive to negotiate when customer cannot credibly threaten to leave. Only negotiation power exists for PERIPHERAL vendors (not platform/compliance vendors) where alternatives exist and switching costs manageable."

Barriers: Customer consent required (cannot force migrations), Integration depth (requires rebuilding 20-50+ integrations), Compliance re-certification (6-18 months per certification), Operations retraining (12-24 months for platform expertise), Capital requirements ($15-500M exceed available funding). Vendor exit timelines (36-48 months) also EXCEED liquidity runway (5-15 months per Stage 5.3) making exits operationally infeasible even if strategically desirable.

VMware 200-300% shock cannot be passed through (would require 20-30% customer increase = 25-40% churn destroying more value than absorbing). Hyperscaler credit reductions can be partially passed through but with churn consequences. Customer switching costs vary: Private Cloud customers have higher switching costs (workload migrations complex), Public Cloud customers have lower switching costs (month-to-month, can exit quickly). NET REALITY: Rackspace SHARES vendor cost increases with customers (part passed through, part absorbed) rather than fully passing through or fully absorbing. This creates MARGIN COMPRESSION over time as vendors continuously increase prices and Rackspace can only partially recover through customer pricing."

Vendor reality: (1) NO NEGOTIATION POWER - Rackspace is price-taker, vendors impose unilateral terms, lock-in eliminates leverage, (2) EXIT INFEASIBLE - timelines 12-48 months all exceed planning cycles and many exceed liquidity runway, capital requirements exceed funding, customer consent blocks unilateral switches, (3) PASS-THROUGH LIMITED - large vendor increases (VMware 200-300%) cannot be fully passed through without triggering unacceptable churn (25-40%), margin compression is inevitable. Vendors have STRUCTURAL POWER over Rackspace economics - can extract value through pricing knowing Rackspace cannot exit and cannot fully pass costs to customers. This creates PROFIT COMPRESSION trajectory - vendor costs increase 10-20% annually, Rackspace can pass through 5-10%, absorbs 5-10% = margin declines over time until business becomes unprofitable."
