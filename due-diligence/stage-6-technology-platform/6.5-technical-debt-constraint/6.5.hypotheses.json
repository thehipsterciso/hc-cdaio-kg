      "notes": "SURPRISING RESULT: Stagnation risk currently LOWER than modernization risk. Debt is expensive ($173-346M annually) but MANAGEABLE - business survives with debt. Modernization attempts risk: Customer churn (VMware 20-40%, multi-cloud 20-30%), operational disruption (integration refactoring), capital depletion ($50-200M programs), execution failures (30-50% of major IT programs fail). Rational strategy is ACCEPT DEBT as permanent cost structure, focus capital on revenue growth not debt paydown. Debt becomes crisis only if: (1) Compounds faster than revenue growth (debt/revenue ratio increases), (2) Platform becomes unsupportable (VMware EOL, hardware unavailable), (3) Competitive obsolescence (customers demand modern platforms Rackspace cannot provide). Timeline: 3-7 years before debt forces action."
