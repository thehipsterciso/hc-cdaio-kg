Coupling patterns: (1) DATA COUPLING - platforms share databases or exchange data requiring schema coordination, (2) API COUPLING - platforms call each other's APIs creating version dependencies, (3) WORKFLOW COUPLING - business processes span multiple platforms requiring coordinated changes, (4) COMPLIANCE COUPLING - certifications cover platform combinations creating change restrictions, (5) ENTITY COUPLING - multi-entity structure requires platform fragmentation. NO EVIDENCE found of successful independent platform changes - all changes require cross-platform coordination. Architecture is NOT service-oriented with clean boundaries - it is MONOLITHIC with distributed components (worst of both worlds: complexity of distributed systems without benefits of modularity). Platform coupling is STRUCTURAL not accidental - business model (hyperscaler pass-through, multi-entity, regulated industries) creates inherent coupling that cannot be architected away."

Seven platforms analyzed show incremental migration is INFEASIBLE or creates WORSE outcomes than big-bang: (1) Compliance platforms cannot run dual systems (audit trail, assessor confusion), (2) Billing cannot incrementally migrate (revenue recognition must be consistent), (3) VMware migration requires customer consent and coordination (cannot unilaterally move subset), (4) UK Sovereign isolation is binary (cannot partially consolidate), (5) IAM parallel run creates permission chaos, (6) Customer-facing platforms create user confusion during incremental migration, (7) Provisioning dual platforms doubles operational burden. INCREMENTAL MIGRATION THEORY: Should reduce risk by limiting blast radius (only some users affected if new platform fails). REALITY: Creates DUAL OPERATIONAL BURDEN (must maintain expertise in both platforms, support both, fix bugs in both) often exceeding cost of big-bang migration. Additionally, incremental migration EXTENDS TIMELINE (months to years vs. weeks for big-bang) during which organization operates in inconsistent state. For platforms with tight coupling, incremental migration is IMPOSSIBLE - must change all integrated systems simultaneously to maintain consistency. Only platforms potentially suitable for incremental migration: Loosely-coupled tools with minimal integration, non-critical functionality (can tolerate new platform failures), small user base (limited coordination required). None of the 8 platforms analyzed meet these criteria - all are critical, highly-integrated, large user base."

Platform vendors have ASYMMETRIC POWER over Rackspace: (1) VMware demonstrates EXTREME exploitation - 200-300% increase with zero negotiation, elimination of perpetual licenses and a la carte purchasing, forced upgrades. Rackspace CANNOT exit despite massive cost increase (customer workload dependencies make exit cost $316-528M revenue loss exceeding $100-210M savings). This is TEXTBOOK VENDOR HOSTAGE situation, (2) Hyperscalers have unilateral pricing power - set list prices, modify partner programs, control credit percentages without Rackspace input (Stage 6.2 analysis), (3) Switching costs exceed vendor price increases - even when alternatives exist (Nutanix, alternative tools), migration cost + customer churn + operational disruption exceed cost of accepting vendor increases, (4) Compliance increases vendor power - FedRAMP/UK Sovereign certified platforms cannot be easily replaced (re-certification timeline 6-18 months), vendors exploit certification lock-in with pricing, (5) No credible build alternative - platform complexity, compliance requirements, time-to-market make in-house development infeasible. ECONOMIC REALITY: Rackspace is PRICE-TAKER not price-negotiator with platform vendors. Must accept whatever pricing vendors impose or exit business (federal government if lose FedRAMP tools, Private Cloud if exit VMware, Public Cloud if hyperscaler terms become unsustainable). Vendor pricing power is PERMANENT FEATURE of business model - managed services provider role is structurally subordinate to platform vendor role (similar to hyperscaler power asymmetry documented in Stage 6.2). Any business model assuming 'negotiate better vendor terms' or 'reduce vendor costs through competitive pressure' will fail - Rackspace lacks leverage."
