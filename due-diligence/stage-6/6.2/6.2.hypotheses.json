Cloud partnerships are NOT balanced relationships - they are ASYMMETRIC DEPENDENCIES where platform owners (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, VMware) have structural power advantages: (1) Set pricing/terms unilaterally, (2) Compete directly with partners while being required suppliers, (3) Represent <0.5% dependency for hyperscalers but 61%+ dependency for Rackspace, (4) Complete information visibility into partner economics, (5) Change-of-control veto over acquisitions. Rackspace has weak countermeasures (cannot exit, cannot vertically integrate, cannot organize partner coalition). Power dynamic is EXTRACTIVE not mutual - hyperscalers can and do squeeze partner margins over time with Rackspace unable to resist effectively. VMware price shock is CURRENT EXAMPLE of unilateral exploitation (200-300% increase, zero negotiation). Balanced relationship assumption is FALSE."

Rackspace cannot credibly threaten to exit any hyperscaler, therefore has zero pricing leverage. Multi-cloud is ADDITIVE DEPENDENCY - must maintain all three hyperscalers simultaneously (AWS ~$600M revenue, Azure ~$600M revenue, Google Cloud ~$250M revenue), cannot afford to lose any single relationship. Rather than reducing lock-in, multi-cloud MULTIPLIES lock-in - locked into AWS AND Azure AND Google Cloud in parallel. Each hyperscaler knows exit is irrational and prices accordingly.

Partner programs provide ECONOMIC BENEFITS (discounts, rebates, co-marketing) but NOT COMPETITIVE PROTECTION. Rackspace competes with hyperscaler direct sales while simultaneously depending on hyperscaler infrastructure - structurally disadvantaged position. Long-term dynamic favors DISINTERMEDIATION as hyperscalers: (1) Improve direct sales efficiency (can serve smaller customers), (2) Expand service portfolios (match partner capabilities), (3) Offer competitive support tiers (replicate partner value).
