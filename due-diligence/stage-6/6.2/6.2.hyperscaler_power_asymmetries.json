Rackspace cannot negotiate pricing - must accept terms offered to partner tier (Advanced Partner, CSP 2-Tier Distributor, etc.). Customer contracts often have infrastructure pass-through clauses allowing Rackspace to pass price increases to customers, BUT customer acceptance not guaranteed - may churn to hyperscaler-direct if Rackspace margin makes total cost higher than direct purchase.",

Cannot: (1) Negotiate alternative pricing (not a large enough customer - hyperscalers view Rackspace as PARTNER not enterprise customer with volume leverage), (2) Threaten to switch hyperscalers (exit cost $50-150M per cloud dependency map - not credible threat), (3) Reduce hyperscaler usage (would lose revenue 1:1), (4) Vertically integrate (building AWS-equivalent infrastructure would cost billions and take years - obviously impossible).
