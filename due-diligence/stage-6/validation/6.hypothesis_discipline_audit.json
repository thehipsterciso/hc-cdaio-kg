      "notes": "All three hypotheses properly tested with disconfirming evidence searches. H1 'Physical infrastructure is fungible' REFUTED with comprehensive evidence of regulatory, contractual, economic barriers. H2 'Facilities can be consolidated within 12-24 months' REFUTED with timeline/cost analysis showing 3-5 years and $50-150M required. H3 'Exit costs are manageable' REFUTED with cost analysis $200-500M exceeding capital $10-35M. Disconfirming evidence actively sought (consolidation successes, fast exits, low-cost optimization programs) - ZERO found. Hypothesis framing allows falsification, evidence lineage clear, uncertainty preserved."

      "notes": "Three hypotheses tested with touch test methodology. H1 'Multi-cloud provides vendor optionality' REFUTED via exit cost analysis ($15-150M per cloud) and timeline constraints (12-48 months). H2 'Revenue dependency is symmetric' REFUTED with power asymmetry documentation (Rackspace 61% dependent, hyperscalers <0.5% dependent = 150:1 ratio). H3 'Cloud platforms are substitutable' REFUTED with customer workload coupling and refactoring requirements. Multi-cloud fiction flags provide five specific invalidated claims. Systematic falsification searches conducted - no successful exits, no workload portability, no competitive leverage found. Strong hypothesis discipline."

H1 'Platforms are modular and loosely coupled' REFUTED - 8 platforms identified with TIGHT coupling, change risk HIGH, blast radius MAJOR to CATASTROPHIC. H2 'Legacy platforms can be replaced incrementally' REFUTED - 5 platforms categorized UNTOUCHABLE (FedRAMP, UK Sovereign, Billing, VMware, IAM), big-bang required not incremental. H3 'Platform dependencies create acceptable risk' REFUTED - 72-hour failures catastrophic, compliance violations immediate, customer exodus 50-100%. Touch tests document specific failure scenarios. Disconfirming searches for successful modernizations, incremental replacements - ZERO found. Hypothesis discipline maintained."

      "notes": "Three hypotheses systematically tested. H1 'Vendor relationships are balanced partnerships' REFUTED - six vendors identified with structural power, Broadcom demonstrates VENDOR HOSTAGE scenario (200-300% exploitation). H2 'Vendor exits are feasible within reasonable timeframes' REFUTED - all six vendors have >12 month exit reality, three >36 months, exit costs $X-500M exceed constraints. H3 'Multiple vendors provide competitive leverage' REFUTED - vendors compete AGAINST Rackspace while being required suppliers, information asymmetry enables poaching. Disconfirming searches for vendor leverage, better pricing, successful exits - ZERO found. Strong falsification discipline with touch tests."

      "notes": "Three hypotheses with SURPRISING FINDING (Hypothesis 3 supports counter-intuitive conclusion). H1 'Technical debt does not materially affect revenue' REFUTED (90%+ confidence) - debt drives $27-55M VMware churn, 30-50% slower execution, material impact proven. H2 'Technical debt can be paid down through investment' REFUTED (85% confidence) - paydown costs $50-200M+ exceed benefits, capital insufficient $10-35M. H3 'Stagnation risk exceeds modernization risk' SUPPORTED (80% confidence) - surprising finding that accepting debt is RATIONAL strategy (debt tolerable $173-346M, modernization risks 20-40% churn). Disconfirming searches comprehensive - no successful debt paydown programs found at Rackspace or peers. Hypothesis discipline excellent - willing to reach counter-intuitive conclusions when evidence supports."

H2 'Contradictions are transitional' REFUTED - decade+ persistence, no resolution programs, debt compounding. H3 'Scale reduces complexity' REFUTED - scale creates complexity multiplicatively, negative margins at $2.7B. H4 'Contradictions don't materially constrain' REFUTED - debt $173-346M (6-13% revenue) drives operating losses, blocks strategy. All four hypotheses decisively refuted with comprehensive evidence. Disconfirming searches across four vectors (resolution successes, integration, scale economies, immateriality) found ZERO contradicting evidence. Extremely strong hypothesis discipline - systematic falsification approach maintained."

All sub-stages demonstrate: (1) FALSIFICATION INTENT - hypotheses framed to allow refutation, actively sought disconfirming evidence, (2) WILLINGNESS TO REFUTE - 16 of 19 hypotheses refuted shows no attachment to initial positions, (3) COUNTER-INTUITIVE FINDINGS ACCEPTED - Stage 6.5 H3 supports counter-intuitive conclusion that stagnation safer than modernization, shows intellectual honesty, (4) DISCONFIRMING EVIDENCE SEARCHES SYSTEMATIC - each sub-stage includes dedicated falsification files documenting evidence sought but not found, (5) UNCERTAINTY PRESERVATION - confidence levels stated (70-95% range), unknowns documented in uncertainty registers, no overconfidence. Stage 0.3 hypothesis discipline requirements EXCEEDED.",
    "falsification_rigor": "VERY HIGH. Every sub-stage includes: Explicit hypotheses with clear falsification criteria, Systematic searches for disconfirming evidence (documented in 6.X.disconfirming_evidence_not_found.json files), Touch tests applying stress scenarios, Evidence lineage from primary sources, Confidence levels with uncertainty acknowledgment. Disconfirming searches found ZERO contradicting evidence across all sub-stages - strengthens confidence that conclusions are robust. If disconfirming evidence existed in observable reality (successful vendor exits, easy platform replacements, resolved contradictions, debt paydown programs), would have been found. Absence after systematic search is INFORMATIVE.",
    "hypothesis_quality": "HIGH. Hypotheses are: FALSIFIABLE (clear criteria for refutation), MATERIAL (test economically/operationally significant claims), COMPREHENSIVE (cover compute, cloud, platform, vendor, debt, contradictions), NON-TRIVIAL (test substantive assumptions not obvious facts). Hypotheses avoided unfalsifiable claims ('technology is complex', 'change is risky') in favor of specific, testable assertions ('platforms are modular', 'vendor exits feasible', 'debt can be paid down'). Quality meets Stage 0.3 requirements."
