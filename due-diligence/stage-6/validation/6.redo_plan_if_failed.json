  "gate_assessment": "Stage 6 PASSES all validation criteria with NO sub-stages requiring redo. Assessment rationale: (1) EXIT CRITERIA: All five criteria MET with significant margin (7 compute dependencies vs 3 required, 5 exit fictions vs 2 required, 8 blast-radius platforms vs 2 required, 6 vendors with leverage vs 1 required, 5 debt areas vs 1 required). (2) CLAIM/EVIDENCE INTEGRITY: All claims trace to documented evidence sources, lineage maintained, no unsupported assertions. (3) HYPOTHESIS DISCIPLINE: 19 hypotheses tested across six sub-stages, 16 refuted showing no confirmation bias, systematic falsification searches conducted, disconfirming evidence sought but not found strengthening conclusions. (4) UNCERTAINTY PRESERVATION: UNKNOWN vs UNKNOWABLE distinctions maintained, ranges not point estimates, confidence levels stated (70-95%), uncertainty registers document gaps. (5) CROSS-STAGE CONSISTENCY: No contradictions found between sub-stages, findings reinforce each other (e.g., VMware vendor power in 6.4 consistent with VMware platform untouchability in 6.3 and VMware debt in 6.5). (6) TOUCH TEST COVERAGE: All major constraints tested with 'what breaks if touched' scenarios, timelines documented, costs quantified, business impacts assessed. (7) CONTRADICTION IDENTIFICATION: Seven major contradictions documented and preserved (not resolved), persistence mechanisms explained. Stage 6 analysis is COMPREHENSIVE, RIGOROUS, and INTERNALLY CONSISTENT. No sub-stages require redo. Proceeding to final gate decision."
