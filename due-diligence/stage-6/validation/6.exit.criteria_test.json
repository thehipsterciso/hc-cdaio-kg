Cloud dependency map documents THREE hyperscaler exits (AWS, Azure, VMware) all categorized LOW or VERY LOW feasibility - exit is THEORETICAL possibility but OPERATIONAL impossibility within survival constraints. Fiction invalidation includes touch tests showing what breaks if exits attempted: customer refusal, capital insufficiency, timeline exceeding runway, churn destroying more value than exit creates. Exit fictions persist for marketing/positioning reasons but have zero operational substance."

All eight exhibit TIGHT coupling with change risk HIGH to MED-HIGH. Touch tests document specific failure scenarios with timelines (1-72 hours to catastrophic impact) and revenue at risk ($50M-$2.7B depending on platform).

Six vendors identified with structural power, with Broadcom demonstrating EXTREME exploitation (vendor hostage scenario where customer locked-in by application dependencies enables 200-300% price increases that must be accepted because exit costs more). THREE hyperscalers (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) collectively control 61% of Rackspace revenue ($1,683M Public Cloud) with ASYMMETRIC POWER: Rackspace 61% dependent on hyperscalers, hyperscalers <0.5% dependent on Rackspace (150:1 ratio). Power mechanisms documented: Licensing (consumption/subscription with unilateral price escalation), Partner Programs (discretionary terms changeable by vendors), Integration Depth (operational dependencies prevent switching), Audit Rights (vendor visibility into Rackspace deployment enables enforcement). Touch tests demonstrate vendor leverage: AWS 20% price increase or Azure PEC reduction creates $25-36M margin impact with NO RECOURSE. Vendor power is PERMANENT CONSTRAINT on profitability - cannot be negotiated away within business constraints."

Debt is comparable in magnitude to $175M operating losses (Stage 5), indicating technical debt is PRIMARY DRIVER of unprofitability. Each debt area includes: Operational manifestation (how it appears day-to-day), Economic impact (quantified costs), Why it persists (structural barriers preventing paydown), Touch test (what breaks if attempted to fix). Key finding: Technical debt is PERMANENT not temporary - all paydown attempts are economically irrational (costs $15-310M per area exceed available capital $10-35M, customer churn 20-50% destroys more value than debt costs). Debt COMPOUNDS over time (Stage 6.5 compound mechanisms) - M&A adds entities, customer demands add clouds, platforms age, integration code accumulates. Business cannot achieve profitability without eliminating debt, but cannot eliminate debt without destroying business. TRAPPED."

  "gate_decision_preliminary": "All five exit criteria MET with significant margin. Stage 6 analysis demonstrates:\n(1) Compute immobility across 7 facilities/regions with structural barriers (regulatory, contractual, customer, cost) preventing exit within 5-15 month runway\n(2) Five major exit fictions invalidated - multi-cloud optionality, workload portability, vendor resilience, and three hyperscaler exits all proven operationally infeasible\n(3) Eight high blast-radius platforms identified - three catastrophic, three severe, two major - with tight coupling and high change risk\n(4) Six vendors exercising structural power through licensing, integration, operational dependency - Broadcom demonstrates extreme vendor hostage exploitation\n(5) Five technical debt areas totaling $173-346M annually (6-13% revenue) - permanent economic constraint preventing profitability\n\nStage 6 provides comprehensive evidence that TECHNOLOGY REALITY creates NON-NEGOTIABLE CONSTRAINTS. Preliminary assessment: PASS. Proceeding to detailed QA checks."
