      "why_it_matters": "$80-160M annual excess cost (3-6% revenue) from operational duplication. Coordination burden slows execution 30-50%. Customer confusion when discover entity boundaries.

      "why_it_matters": "Multi-cloud creates COST not VALUE - operational efficiency 20-30% worse than single-cloud specialist. Hyperscalers have pricing power (can reduce credits extracting $25-36M margin per cloud). Cannot consolidate without losing 30-50% customers. Marketing fiction obscures operational reality - if customers/investors discover depth of lock-in, trust damage. Debt is permanent - scale INCREASES multi-cloud burden not reduces it.",

Business cannot achieve profitability through growth - complexity compounds faster than revenue.

Contradictions are NOT temporary misalignments awaiting fix - they are PERMANENT STRUCTURAL FEATURES.",
    "resolution_feasibility": "NEAR ZERO within business survival constraints. Each contradiction resolution requires: Capital $15-500M (exceeds availability $10-35M), Timeline 12-48+ months (exceeds runway 5-15 months), Customer consent (40-60% refusal expected), Regulatory approval (6-18 months per certification). Economic analysis: Resolution costs EXCEED contradiction costs in all cases - accepting contradictions is rational strategy vs. attempting resolution that destroys business. Only resolution paths are EXTERNAL (acquisition with capital, bankruptcy restructuring forcing change) or FAILURE (contradictions compound until business unsustainable).",
    "strategic_implication": "Contradictions create STRATEGIC PARALYSIS - cannot pursue strategies that assume resolving contradictions. Any plan requiring: Global infrastructure consolidation (blocked by jurisdictional isolation), Cloud rationalization (blocked by triple lock-in), Vendor exits (blocked by customer dependencies), Platform modernization (blocked by compliance re-certifications and customer consent), Operational standardization (blocked by customer heterogeneity and regulatory fragmentation) - ALL INFEASIBLE. Strategy must ACCEPT contradictions as permanent constraints and work within them. This severely limits strategic options available."
