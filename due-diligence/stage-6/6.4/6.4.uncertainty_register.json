For each critical vendor need to know: (1) Alternative vendors (who are they? how many exist?), (2) Feature parity (do alternatives match current vendor capabilities?), (3) Certification status (do alternatives have FedRAMP, ISO 27001, etc.?), (4) Pricing (are alternatives cheaper, similar, or more expensive?), (5) Migration path (do alternatives provide migration tools/services?), (6) Customer references (have peer companies successfully migrated to alternatives?). Examples: (1) VMware alternatives (Nutanix, Proxmox, KVM, Hyper-V) - which is best match for Rackspace scale and requirements?, (2) Monitoring alternatives (Datadog vs. New Relic vs. Dynatrace vs. Prometheus/Grafana) - which provides needed features?, (3) Backup alternatives (Veeam vs. Commvault vs. Rubrik vs. Cohesity) - which handles Rackspace scale?. Without alternative assessment: Cannot determine if vendor lock-in is ABSOLUTE (no alternatives exist) or ECONOMIC (alternatives exist but switching cost exceeds benefit).",

Contract mix matters: If 80% of revenue has pass-through clauses = vendor increases manageable (most passed to customers), If 80% has fixed pricing = vendor increases catastrophic (Rackspace absorbs all costs). Additionally: Enterprise customers likely have better terms (negotiated pricing, protections), SMB customers likely have standard terms (less protection). Revenue mix by contract type determines financial impact of vendor cost increases.",

Examples: (1) Private equity acquirer likely has NO vendor conflicts (financial buyer), can maintain Rackspace vendor relationships, (2) Strategic acquirer (Oracle, IBM, Cisco) may have MAJOR vendor conflicts requiring complex resolutions, (3) Hyperscaler acquiring Rackspace (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) creates FUNDAMENTAL conflict (would eliminate multi-cloud positioning, other hyperscalers might refuse continued partnerships). Without knowing acquirer identity cannot assess vendor integration complexity or synergies.",

Pre-transaction preparation: (1) Document all vendor relationships comprehensively (contracts, spending, integration points), (2) Identify vendor change-of-control provisions (which require consent/notification), (3) Assess vendor switching costs and timelines (so acquirer understands constraints), (4) Develop vendor integration scenarios for different acquirer types (PE, strategic tech, hyperscaler) showing costs/benefits. Reduces due diligence time and provides acquirer with clear vendor landscape."

Uncertainties affect PRECISION (exact contract terms, exact price increases, exact customer churn rates) but NOT DIRECTION (vendors have structural power, exit is infeasible, pass-through is limited). Key findings ROBUST: (1) VENDOR POWER documented through observed behavior (Broadcom 200-300% increase happened, hyperscalers set terms unilaterally), (2) EXIT INFEASIBILITY proven through timeline and cost analysis (36-48 months, $50-500M costs, customer churn 30-50%), (3) PASS-THROUGH LIMITS demonstrated through touch tests (large increases trigger unacceptable churn). Unknowns would refine tactics (which vendor to exit first if forced, exact churn elasticity, optimal pass-through percentage) but strategic assessment clear: Vendors control critical dependencies, can exploit through pricing, Rackspace has limited countermeasures. Additional information would improve precision but not change fundamental conclusion that vendor power is structural business constraint."
