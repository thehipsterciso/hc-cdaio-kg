All hypotheses include explicit disconfirming evidence searches documented in 8.1.disconfirming_evidence_searched.json. Pattern: 6 hypotheses STRENGTHENED by disconfirming evidence search (expected positive evidence not found, supporting original negative assessment), 1 hypothesis PARTIALLY DISCONFIRMED (supply chain breaches are industry-wide not Rackspace-specific, though Exchange was Rackspace failure), 3 hypotheses UNCERTAIN (lack of public data prevents confirmation/disconfirmation). Disconfirming search ACTIVELY CONDUCTED not performative - searched for evidence of successful defense, patch management improvements, elite security capabilities, consolidation approvals, competitor failures validating Rackspace conservatism. Result: Original conclusions validated or refined, not simply confirmed. NO ISSUES with hypothesis discipline."

Hypothesis H8.2.1 (GDPR processor prohibition) STRONGLY SUPPORTED with no disconfirming evidence found. H8.2.2 (sector-specific sterilization) SUPPORTED with attempted disconfirmation via searching for healthcare/federal analytics products (none found). H8.2.3 (geographic fragmentation) STRONGLY SUPPORTED with overwhelming evidence. H8.2.4 (social license constraints) SUPPORTED but noted as hard to isolate from legal constraints (appropriately qualified). H8.2.5 (structural inferiority to hyperscalers) STRONGLY SUPPORTED with clear asymmetry documented. Each hypothesis includes explicit disconfirming evidence searches. Pattern: Looked for evidence of customer permissions, controller status, successful anonymization, data products, consolidation solutions - NONE FOUND. Appropriately distinguished between 'absence of evidence' and 'evidence of absence'. NO ISSUES with hypothesis discipline."

      "notes": "Stage 8.3 tested 5 hypotheses about regulatory speed, watchlists, licensing regimes, information asymmetry, and enforcement multiplication. H1 (underestimating intervention speed) SUPPORTED via pattern of no public discussion of rapid enforcement timelines + SEC CL0P non-disclosure. H2 (multiple watchlists) SUPPORTED via regulatory notification requirements + absence of disclosure. H3 (effective licensing) SUPPORTED via linguistic analysis of risk disclosures. H4 (information asymmetry) SUPPORTED via comparing regulator real-time feeds vs stakeholder quarterly reporting. H5 (enforcement multiplication) SUPPORTED via lack of coordination evidence. Disconfirming evidence searches included looking for: explicit fast-timeline discussions, public watchlist disclosures, regulatory coordination agreements, consolidated investigation processes. Appropriate use of INFERENCE classification when direct observation impossible (private company, regulatory processes opaque). NO ISSUES with hypothesis discipline."

Hypotheses tested via disconfirming evidence searches documented in 8.4.disconfirming_evidence_searched.json. Pattern: Searched for evidence that immobility is TEMPORARY or SOLVABLE (logical isolation alternatives, regulatory flexibility, competitive parity in cost structures, successful consolidation precedents) - minimal disconfirming evidence found. One PARTIAL DISCONFIRMATION: FedRAMP CONUS requirement appears INDUSTRY-STANDARD not Rackspace-conservative (AWS GovCloud, Azure Government also CONUS-only), requiring hypothesis refinement. Appropriately distinguished between different types of immobility (ABSOLUTE statutory like China CSL vs CONDITIONAL with transfer mechanisms like EU GDPR vs PRACTICAL customer refusal like HIPAA offshore). NO ISSUES with hypothesis discipline."

All 5 hypotheses rated SUPPORTED with explicit supporting and disconfirming evidence documented. H1 (governance as veto) searched for evidence of approved major initiatives and governance balanced metrics - NOT FOUND. H2 (informal power) searched for formal rejection votes and accountability for delays - NOT FOUND. H3 (escalation asymmetry) searched for successful operational escalations and CEO overrides of CISO - NOT FOUND. H4 (post-SEC defensive shift) found MIXED evidence (legal interpretation divided) appropriately qualifying conclusion. H5 (regulatory authority amplification) found PARTIAL DISCONFIRMATION for FedRAMP (appears industry-standard) appropriately refining hypothesis. Disconfirming searches were SUBSTANTIVE not performative - actively looked for counter-evidence including governance approval examples, escalation successes, CEO-CISO override precedents. NO ISSUES with hypothesis discipline."

  "overall_hypothesis_discipline_assessment": "Stage 8 demonstrates STRONG hypothesis discipline across all 5 sub-stages. Total 29 falsifiable hypotheses tested with explicit supporting AND disconfirming evidence searches documented. Pattern: Disconfirming searches actively conducted, not performative checkbox exercises. When disconfirming evidence found (rare, ~10% of searches), appropriately integrated and hypotheses refined. When disconfirming evidence NOT found despite active search, appropriately strengthened confidence in original hypothesis while acknowledging 'absence of evidence is not evidence of absence'. Appropriate use of INFERENCE classification when direct observation impossible (private company operations, opaque regulatory processes, internal governance dynamics). Appropriate epistemic humility: preserved uncertainties, qualified conclusions, distinguished between 'cannot confirm' (lack of data) vs 'confirmed negative' (searched and found nothing). CONFIRMATION BIAS RISK: LOW across all sub-stages. NO REMEDIATION REQUIRED."
