      "why_it_matters": "Cannot determine if JAB tolerance has CEILING (fourth incident triggers suspension) or UNLIMITED (JAB accepts MSP breach pattern as industry norm). Affects federal business risk assessment - is federal revenue stable or at imminent suspension risk? Also cannot determine if incidents were CONTAINED (no federal data affected, justifying JAB tolerance) or JAB is simply SLOW to act (suspension coming but delayed). Uncertainty prevents confident federal business valuation.",

Either: (1) Business case is WRONG (savings don't exist or technical infeasibility), (2) Apollo DENIED capital (suggests Apollo benefits from conservatism not frustrated by it), (3) Governance BLOCKED despite Apollo support (proves governance veto unoverrideable even by controlling shareholder), or (4) Management NEVER PROPOSED (suggests either lack of capability to identify opportunity or awareness that proposal would be rejected)",
      "why_it_matters": "Each explanation has different implications for acquirer. If (1) business case wrong, consolidation not opportunity. If (2) Apollo denied capital, Apollo values downside protection over EBITDA improvement (acquirer should not expect Apollo pressure for reform). If (3) governance blocked despite Apollo, proves governance veto is ABSOLUTE (acquirer must plan to replace governance layer to achieve consolidation). If (4) management never proposed, suggests management capability gap (awareness, strategic planning, business case development). Cannot determine which without insider knowledge of what consolidation proposals were made and Apollo/governance responses. Contradiction suggests SOME EXPLANATION is false: either consolidation savings don't exist, or Apollo/governance blocking for reasons not visible.",

Either: (1) Hyperscalers are VIOLATING (illegal, enforcement pending), (2) Hyperscalers found LEGAL MECHANISM (anonymization, controller status, synthetic data) Rackspace cannot replicate due to scale/sophistication gap, or (3) Hyperscaler 'data businesses' are built on THEIR OWN operational data not customer workload data (structural advantage of infrastructure ownership vs Rackspace intermediary position)",
      "why_it_matters": "If (1) hyperscalers violating, regulatory crackdown coming creating industry-wide constraint on data businesses (Rackspace correctly assessing impossibility). If (2) hyperscalers have legal mechanism, Rackspace has EXECUTION GAP not LEGAL PROHIBITION (constraint is capability not law, can be solved with investment). If (3) infrastructure ownership is prerequisite for data leverage, Rackspace's intermediary business model STRUCTURALLY INFERIOR (cannot be fixed without vertical integration into infrastructure ownership, fundamentally different business). Hypothesis 8.2 H5 suggests (3) is explanation but cannot definitively rule out (1) or (2).

Either: (1) UK Sovereign is NEW BUILD (greenfield, no integration risk) vs consolidation is INTEGRATION (migration risk, customer disruption) explaining differential approval, OR (2) Governance approves GROWTH initiatives (UK Sovereign enters new market) but blocks OPTIMIZATION initiatives (consolidation reduces costs but not revenue), suggesting bias toward expansion over efficiency",
      "why_it_matters": "If (1) greenfield vs integration explains differential, suggests governance could approve FedRAMP + commercial consolidation if implemented as MIGRATION TO NEW PLATFORM (build consolidated architecture, migrate customers) rather than IN-PLACE CONSOLIDATION (combine existing platforms). This is SOLVABLE technical architecture question not governance veto. If (2) governance biases toward growth over efficiency, explains Apollo frustration - Apollo wants EBITDA improvement for exit (efficiency) but governance only approves revenue growth initiatives (which take 3-5 years to mature, past exit window). Suggests governance reform target should be REBALANCING priorities not wholesale replacement. Cannot determine which explanation without understanding UK Sovereign approval process and rationale.",

Audit Committee uses breach history to justify BLOCKING changes (cannot risk another breach) but doesn't use breach history to mandate CHANGING security architecture (current architecture is what's being breached)",

Status quo is HIGH RISK (proven by three breaches) but changing status quo is ALSO HIGH RISK (per governance assessment). Result: organization stuck in WORST of both worlds - maintains high-risk fragmented architecture because governance blocks both business optimization (consolidation) and security modernization (architecture changes). Only resolution is ACCEPT that current state is riskier than proposed changes, but three breaches make governance EXTRA risk-averse not less. Suggests need for EXTERNAL intervention (acquirer, Apollo directive) to break governance paralysis - cannot self-correct because governance risk framing prevents change regardless of status quo risk level.",
